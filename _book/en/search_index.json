You can literally build prototypes in minutes and production ready applications in days. Feathers achieves this by being a thin wrapper over top of some amazing battle tested open source technologies and adding a few core pieces like Hooks and Services.\nIf you've decided that Feathers might be for you and you haven't tried the tutorial, feel free to dive right in and learn about the basics.

Here are some of the things that you get out of the box with Feathers. All of them are optional so you can choose exactly what you need. No more, no less.\nWe like to think of Feathers as a \"batteries included but easily swappable\" framework.\n\n  \n    Instant REST APIs\n    Feathers automatically provides REST APIs for all your services. This industry best practice makes it easy for mobile applications, a web front-end and other developers to communicate with your application.\n  \n  \n    Unparalleled Database Support\n    With Feathers service adapters you can connect to all of the most popular databases, and query them with a unified interface no matter which one you use. This makes it easy to swap databases and use entirely different DBs in the same app without changing your application code.\n  \n  \n    Real Time\n    Feathers services can notify clients when something has been created, updated or removed. To get even better performance, you can communicate with your services through websockets, by sending and receiving data directly.\n  \n  \n    Cross-Cutting Concerns\n    Using \"hooks\" you have an extremely flexible way to share common functionality or concerns. Keeping with the Unix philosophy, these hooks are small functions that do one thing and are easily tested but can be chained to create complex processes.\n  \n  \n    Universal Usage\n    Services and hooks are a powerful and flexible way to build full stack applications. In addition to the server, these constructs also work incredibly well on the client. That's why Feathers works the same in NodeJS, the browser and React Native.\n  \n  \n    Authentication\n    Almost every app needs authentication so Feathers comes with support for email/password, OAuth and Token (JWT) authentication out of the box.\n  \n  \n    Pagination\n    Today's applications are very data rich so most of the time you cannot load all the data for a resource all at once. Therefore, Feathers gives you pagination for every service from the start.\n  \n  \n    Error Handling\n    Feathers removes the pain of defining errors and handling them. Feathers services automatically return appropriate errors, including validation errors, and return them to the client in a easily consumable format.\n  \n\n"},"guides/about/philosophy.html":{"url":"guides/about/philosophy.html","title":"Philosophy","keywords":"","body":"The Feathers Philosophy\nWe know! You're probably screaming \"Not another JavaScript framework!\". We've also become frustrated with all the Rails clones and MVC frameworks that don't do anything different. Instead, a few years ago we started to explore a different approach to building web applications using services and cross cutting concerns while also being careful not to reinvent the wheel.\nWith this experimentation Feathers has grown into what it is today. Our core philosophy that guides Feathers is still the same as it was years ago:\n\n\"Monolithic apps tend to fall apart at scale, either because of performance or because there are too many people in the code. What if we could make it easy to build applications that can naturally become service oriented from day one, rather than having to start with a large application and painfully tease it apart?\nWhat if we could make a framework that grows with you and your business and makes it easy for you to transition to a series of microservices, or easily change databases without ripping our code apart?\nWhat if we could make real-time less intimidating rather than a hacky, complex after thought? What if we could remove the boilerplate needed for building REST APIs? Could we build a framework that provides enough structure to get going easily and add all the common pieces that modern apps need, but still keep everything flexible and optional?\nA framework itself should not be opinionated. It should be made up of small, reusable, optional components that do one thing well but are combined in an opinionated way. By keeping the components of your application small, flexible and optional you eliminate much of the engineering obstacles that prevent moving fast and scaling.\"\n\nWe strongly believe that your UI, data and business logic are the core of any web or mobile application and your framework should take care of the rest so you can focus on the things that matter.\nServices\nMany web frameworks focus on things like rendering views, defining routes and handling HTTP requests and responses without providing a structure for implementing application logic separate from those secondary concerns. The result - even when using the MVC pattern - are monolithic applications with messy controllers or fat models. Your actual application logic and how your data is accessed are all mixed up together.\nFeathers brings 3 important concepts together that help to separate those concerns from how your application works and give you incredible flexibility while still keeping things DRY.\nA service layer which helps to decouple your application logic from how it is being accessed and represented. Besides also making things a lot easier to test - you just call your service methods instead of having to make fake HTTP requests - this is what allows Feathers to provide the same API through both HTTP REST and websockets. It can even be extended to use any other RPC protocol and you won't have to change any of your services.\nUniform Interfaces\nEvery Feathers service exposes a uniform interface modeled after REST. Where, just like one of the key constraints of REST, your action context is immediately apparent due to the naming convention. With REST you have the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE). This translates naturally to a Feathers service object interface:\nconst myService = {\n  // GET /path\n  find(params, callback) {},\n  // GET /path/\n  get(id, params, callback) {},\n  // POST /path\n  create(data, params, callback) {},\n  // PUT /path/\n  update(id, data, params, callback) {},\n  // PATCH /path/\n  patch(id, data, params, callback) {},\n  // DELETE /path/\n  remove(id, params, callback) {}\n}\n\nThis interface also makes it easier to \"hook\" into the execution of those methods and emit events when they return which can naturally be used to provide real-time functionality.\nHooks\nCross cutting concerns are an extremely powerful part of aspect oriented programming. They are a very good fit for web and mobile applications since the majority are primarily CRUD applications with lots of shared functionality. Keeping with the Unix philosophy we believe that small modules that do one thing are better than large complex ones. That's why you can create before and after hooks and chain them together to create very complex processes while still maintaining modularity and flexibility.\nBuilt on the Shoulders of Giants\nBecause we utilize some already proven modules, we spend less time re-inventing the wheel, are able to move incredibly fast, and have small well-tested, stable modules.\nHere's how we use some of the tech under the hood:\n\nFeathers extends Express 4, the most popular web framework for NodeJS.\nOur CLI tool uses commander and its generators are built with Yeoman.\nWe wrap Socket.io or Primus as your websocket transport.\nOur service adapters typically wrap mature ORMs like mongoose, sequelize or knex.\nnpm for package management.\npassport for much of the feathers-authentication work.\n\n"},"guides/about/vs.html":{"url":"guides/about/vs.html","title":"Feathers vs. X","keywords":"","body":"Feathers vs X\nThe following sections compare Feathers to other software choices that seem similar or may overlap with the use cases of Feathers.\nDue to the bias of these comparisons being on the Feathers website, we attempt to only use facts.

Just like Feathers, Firebase provides REST and real-time APIs but also includes CDN support. Feathers on the other hand leaves setting up a CDN and hosting your Feathers app up to the developer.\nFirebase is a closed-source, paid hosted service starting at 5$/month with the next plan level starting at 49$/month. Feathers is open source and can run on any hosting platform like Heroku, Modulus or on your own servers like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean and your local machine. Because Firebase can't be run locally you typically need to pay for both a shared development environment on top of any production and testing environment. \nFirebase has JavaScript and mobile clients and also provides framework specific bindings. Feathers currently focuses on universal usage in JavaScript environments and does not have any framework specific bindings. Mobile applications can use Feathers REST and websocket endpoints directly but at the moment there are no Feathers specific iOS and Android SDKs.\nFirebase currently supports offline mode whereas that is currently left up to the developer with Feathers. We do however have a proposal for this feature.\nBoth Firebase and Feathers support email/password, token, and OAuth authentication. Firebase has not publicly disclosed the database technology they use to store your data behind their API but it seems to be an SQL variant. Feathers supports multiple databases, NoSQL and SQL alike.\nFor more technical details on the difference and how to potentially migrate an application you can read how to use Feathers as an open source alternative to Firebase.\nFeathers vs Meteor\nBoth Feathers and Meteor are open source real-time JavaScript platforms that provide front end and back end support. They both allow clients to send and receive messages over websockets. Feathers lets you choose which real-time transport(s) you want to use via socket.io or Primus, while Meteor relies on SockJS.\nFeathers is community supported, whereas Meteor is venture backed and has raised 31.2 million dollars to date.\nMeteor only has official support for MongoDB but there are some community modules of various levels of quality that support other databases. Meteor has it's own package manager and package ecosystem. They have their own template engine called Blaze which is based off of Mustache along with their own build system, but also have guides for Angular and React.\nFeathers has official support for many more databases and supports any front-end framework or view engine that you want by working seamlessly on the client.\nFeathers uses the defacto JavaScript package manager npm. As a result you can utilize the hundreds of thousands of modules published to npm. Feathers lets you decide whether you want to use Gulp, Grunt, Browserify, Webpack or any other build tool.\nMeteor has optimistic UI rendering and oplog tailing whereas currently Feathers leaves that up to the developer. However, we've found that being universal and utilizing websockets for both sending and receiving data alleviates the need for optimistic UI rendering and complex data diffing in most cases.\nBoth Meteor and Feathers provide support for email/password and OAuth authentication. Once authenticated Meteor uses sessions to maintain a logged in state, whereas Feathers keeps things stateless and uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to assess authentication state.\nOne big distinction is how Feathers and Meteor provide real-time across a cluster of apps. Feathers does it at the service layer or using another pub-sub service like Redis whereas Meteor relies on having access to and monitoring MongoDB operation logs as the central hub for real-time communication.\nFeathers vs Sails\nFrom a feature standpoint, Feathers and Sails are probably the most similar of the comparisons offered here. Both provide real-time REST API's, multiple DB support, and are client-agnostic. Sails is bound to the server whereas Feathers can also be used in the browser and in React Native apps. Both frameworks use Express, with Feathers supporting the latest Express 4, while Sails supports Express 3.\nSails follows the MVC pattern while Feathers provides lightweight services to define your resources. Feathers uses hooks to define your business logic including validations, security policies, and serialization in reusable, chainable modules, whereas with Sails, these reside in more of a configuration file format.\nFeathers supports multiple ORMs while Sails only supports its own Waterline ORM.\nSails allows you to receive messages via websockets on the client, but, unlike Feathers, does not directly support data being sent from the client to the server over websockets. Additionally, Sails uses Socket.io for its websocket transport. Feathers also supports Socket.io but also many other socket implementations via Primus.\nEven though the features are very similar, Feathers achieves this with much less code. Feathers also doesn't assume how you want to manage your assets or that you even have any (because you might be making a JSON API). Instead of coming bundled with Grunt, Feathers lets you use your build tool of choice.\nSails doesn't come with any built-in authentication support. Instead, it offers guides on how to configure Passport. By contrast, Feathers supports an official authentication plugin that is a drop-in, minimal configuration, module that provides email/password, token, and OAuth authentication much more like Meteor. Using this you can authenticate using those providers over REST and/or sockets interchangeably.\nScaling a Sails app is as simple as deploying your large app multiple times behind a load balancer with some pub-sub mechanism like Redis. With Feathers you can do the same but you also have the option to mount sub-apps more like Express, spin up additional services in the same app, or split your services into small standalone microservice applications.\n"},"guides/step-by-step/readme.html":{"url":"guides/step-by-step/readme.html","title":"The Basics","keywords":"","body":"Step by Step Intro to Basic Feathers\nFeathers is a REST and realtime API layer for modern applications.\n[FeathersJS'] signature feature [is] that it‚Äôs super lightweight.\nIt contains a simple and logical workflow that streamlines building apis\nand can make an api that would have taken hours and builds it in minutes.\nIt hits the perfect balance of magic and control\nwhere you still have full control over how your api behaves\nbut the tools provided make your life so much easier. --\nMedium - \"FeathersJS‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA framework that will spoil you\"\n\nWarning: Feathers is addictive.\n\nServices\nServices are the heart of Feathers, as this is what all clients will interact with.\nThey are middlemen and can be used to perform operations of any kind.\n\ninteract with a database\ninteract with a microservice/API\ninteract with the filesystem\ninteract with other resources\nsend an email,\nprocess a payment,\nreturn the current weather for a location, etc.\n\n\n\nHooks\nHooks are functions that run automatically before or after a service is called upon.\nThey can be service gatekeepers and make sure that all operations are allowed and have the required information.\nThey can also make sure that only data that should be returned to a client is returned.\n\nbefore hooks: validate/cleanse/check permissions.\nafter hooks: add additional data or remove unneeded data before it's sent to the client.\n\nEvents\nEvents are sent to clients (or other servers if the feathers-sync package is used)\nwhen a service method completes.\nThe created, updated, patched, and removed events provide real-time functionality\nEvent Filtering determines which users should receive an event.\nThis is the Feathers alternative to Socket.io's rooms\nand it's an extremely intelligent approach that enables reactive applications to scale well.\nAuthentication\nFeathers provides\nlocal,\nJSON Web Token,\nOAuth1\nand OAuth2 authentication\n(using PassportJS)\nover REST\nand WebSockets.\nProviders\nChoose which providers to use in your application.\n\nREST\nSocket.io\nPrimus\n(supporting\nengine.io,\nuWebSockets a.k.a. uws,\nSockJS,\nFaye)\n\nMiddleware\nExpress middleware\nhandles the extra fluff that isn't exactly necessary,\nbut can be nice for optimization/logging.\n\nbefore service methods: compression, CORS, etc.\nafter service methods: logs, error handlers, etc.\n\nThis guide's purpose\nThis guide covers\n\nServices used with a database.\nHooks.\nEvents.\nProviders.\n\nIt does not assume any prior knowledge of Feathers.\nBy the time you finish this guide, you will\n\nhave a solid understanding of Feathers basics.\nunderstand how Feathers permits your code to be database agnostic.\nunderstand how a Feathers server simultaneously and transparently supports a HTTP REST API,\nFeathers REST clients, and Feathers WebSocket clients.\nunderstand that you can access your database from the client\nas if that client code was running on the server.\nunderstand that the Feathers generators will structure your application for you,\nand you will understand the boilerplate they produce.\n\nBy the time you finish this guide, you will be ready to write your first app.\n"},"guides/step-by-step/intro/readme.html":{"url":"guides/step-by-step/intro/readme.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nWe will start with writing snippets of Feathers code by hand.\nWe'll take a step by step approach, introducing a few new concepts each time.\nEach step is backed by a working example in the examples/step/ folder of the docs.\nThe code samples in this guide are extracts from those examples.\nCode snippets may be ambiguous, misleading or confusing.\nWorking examples reduce these problems,\nand let you learn more by modifying them yourself.\nOne example may continue with changes from a previous example.\nIn such cases, a summary of the differences between the two examples may be shown\nto help you understand the changes.\n\nWarning.

Promise.all([ ... ]).then(results => { ... });\nPromise.all takes an array whose elements are JavaScript values or Promises.\nIt returns a single Promise that will resolve if every promise in the array\nis resolved or reject if any promise in the array is rejected.\nThe elements are resolved in parallel, not sequentially,\nso Promise.all is a great pattern with which to start independent actions.\nThe then portion is called once all elements are resolved.\nIt receives an array as a parameter.\nThe n-th element of the array is the resolved value of the n-th element in Promise.all.\n\nThe 3 user items are now in the database, their values are returned in results.\nWe issue a find for the entire table and print the results.\n\n  .then(results => {\n    console.log('created Jane Doe item\\n', results[0]);\n    console.log('created John Doe item\\n', results[1]);\n    console.log('created Judy Doe item\\n', results[2]);\n\n    return users.find()\n      .then(results => console.log('find all items\\n', results));\n  })\n  .catch(err => console.log('Error occurred:', err));\n\n\n Promise Refresher. user.find().then(results => ...);\nuser.find() returns a Promise. .then(results => ...) waits for the Promise to resolve,\ni.e. for the find to finish.\nThe zero, one or more items found in the table are returned in the results param.\n\n| View the completed file db-connector/1.js.\nService methods\nFeathers provides the following\nservice methods:\nfind(params)\nget(id, params)\ncreate(data, params)\nupdate(id, data, params)\npatch(id, data, params)\nremove(id, params)\n\nFeathers supports a common way\nfor querying, sorting, limiting and selecting find method calls\nas part of params, e.g. { query: { ... }, ... }.\nQuerying also applies to update, patch and remove method calls if the id is set to null.\n\n ProTip: The find method does not guarantee an order for the returned items.\n\nResults\nRun the program with node ./examples/step/01/db-connector/1.js.\nThe console displays:\nfeathers-guide$ node ./examples/step/01/a/1\ncreated Jane Doe item\n { email: 'jane.doe@gmail.com',\n  password: 'X2y6',\n  role: 'admin',\n  _id: '6Rq7O4RPYEO2TdAn' }\ncreated John Doe item\n { email: 'john.doe@gmail.com',\n  password: 'i6He',\n  role: 'user',\n  _id: 'Q2bnsBRfO1ScqoqY' }\ncreated Judy Doe item\n { email: 'judy.doe@gmail.com',\n  password: '7jHw',\n  role: 'user',\n  _id: 'Tymf6Nailusd5MZD' }\nfind all items\n [ { email: 'jane.doe@gmail.com',\n    password: 'X2y6',\n    role: 'admin',\n    _id: '6Rq7O4RPYEO2TdAn' },\n  { email: 'john.doe@gmail.com',\n    password: 'i6He',\n    role: 'user',\n    _id: 'Q2bnsBRfO1ScqoqY' },\n  { email: 'judy.doe@gmail.com',\n    password: '7jHw',\n    role: 'user',\n    _id: 'Tymf6Nailusd5MZD' } ]\n\n\nBoilerplate.

middleware\nLinux pipes\nOne of the more powerful features of Linux is pipes,\nwhich has shaped its toolbox philosophy.\nA pipeline is a sequence of processes chained together,\nso that the output of each process feeds directly as input to the next one.\nFor example, to list files in the current directory (ls),\nretain only the lines of ls output containing the string \"key\" (grep),\nand view the result in a scrolling page (less),\na user types the following into the command line of a terminal:\nls -l | grep key | less\n\nExpress middleware\nAt the heart of pipes lies a design pattern:\nChain of Responsibility (CoR).\nThe CoR pattern uses a chain of objects to handle a request.\nObjects in the chain forward the request along the chain.\nProcessing stops after an event is handled.\n\nExpress\nmiddleware\nuses the CoR pattern.\nYou should be familiar with the following code if you've ever used Express.\nA HTTP request is handled by each of these Express functions in sequence.\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(helmet());\napp.use(compress());\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\napp.use(favicon(path.join(app.get('public'), 'favicon.ico')));\napp.use('/', feathers.static(app.get('public')));\n\nThe CoR pattern promotes the idea of loose coupling\nand it lets us combine simple functions to build solutions for specific needs.\nFeathers hooks\nApplications are about more than the reading and writing of raw database items.\nApplication-specific logic often needs to run before and after service calls.\nYou will implement most of your business requirements with service hooks,\nwhich are middleware functions that run for each service method.\nFeathers calls the data passed between these hooks the context object\n(in order not to confused them with the HTTP request object).\nHook middleware is organized like this:\n\nand the corresponding Feathers code would be:\nconst messagesHooks = {\n  before: {\n    create: [ hook31(), hook32() ]\n  },\n  after: {\n    create: hook35()\n  }\n};\nconst messages = app.service('messages');\nmessages.hooks(messagesHooks);\n\nYou can see that a series of hooks are run between the service call and the actual call to the database.\nThese hooks may, for example:\n\nEnsure the user is authenticated,\nEnsure the user is allowed to perform this operation,\nValidate the data for the service call. i.e. the data in the context object,\nUpdate the record's updatedAt value, thus modifying the context object,\nPerhaps not allow the service call to proceed, or return a specified response for it.\n\n\nProTip Hooks may be synchronous or async (using promises or async/await).\nThe next hook will run only when the current one finishes (sync) or resolves (async),\nso hooks are always run sequentially.\n\nA series of hooks is also run after the actual call to the database, if that call was successful.\nThese hooks may:\n\nPopulate the response with related information,\ne.g. information about the user who created the returned record,\nRemove information for security reasons, e.g. the user password.\n\nYou can implement all your business logic related to service calls with hooks.\n\nProTip The DB call is middleware too!\nIt uses the information in the context object to call the database,\nand then updates context with the result.\nProTip Services are usually database adapters, but they need not be.\nYou can create a service which writes to the server log for example.\nA client could post logs using this service.\nHooks may be defined for all services, regardless of their type.\nProTip Some people may call the context object the hook object.\nThe two terms are interchangeable.\n\nIs anything wrong, unclear, missing?\nLeave a

database adapter,\nor by your own code.\nYour hook can, for example, return a formatted message as follows:\n// On server\nconst errors = require('feathers-errors');\nthrow new errors.BadRequest('Invalid request', {errors: {email: 'Invalid Email'} }); // inside hook\n\n// On client\nmessages.create(...)\n  .then(data => ...)\n  .catch(err => {\n    console.log(err.messages);

Feathers hashes passwords using bcrypt.\nbcrypt has the best kind of repute that can be achieved for a cryptographic algorithm:\nit has been around for quite some time, used quite widely, \"attracted attention\",\nand yet remains unbroken to date.\n(Reference.)\nJSON webtoken. Feathers Authentication uses JSON webtoken (JWT) for secure authentication\nbetween a client and server as opposed to cookies and sessions.\nThe cookies vs token debate\nfavors token-based authentication.\nThe avoidance of sessions makes Feathers apps more easily scalable.\n\n- setCreatedAt(), setUpdatedAt()\nThese hooks add createdAt and updatedAt properties to the data.\n- userService.after({ ... });\nThese hooks are run after the operation on the database.\nThey act on all the results returned by the operation.\n- unless(hook => hook.method === 'find', remove('password'))\n\nhook => hook.method === 'find' returns true if the database operation was a find.\nAll hooks are passed a hook object\nwhich contains information about the operation.\n\nremove('password')\nremoves the password property from the results.\n\nunless(predicate, ...hooks)\nruns the hooks if the predicate is false.\n\n\nIts not secure to return the encoded password to the client, so this hook removes it.\nWe have made an exception for the find operation because we want you to see something\nin the results.\n\nHooks. We are now doing some processing typical of apps.\nBefore we add a new user, we verify the data, encode the password,\nand add createdAt plus updatedAt properties.\nWe remove the password field before we return the results to the client.\n\nHooks\nMany of your common needs are already handled by hooks in the\ncommon hooks library.\nThis may significantly reduce the code you need to write.\nHooks are just small middleware functions that get applied before and after a service method executes.\nHooks are transport independent. It does not matter if the service request come through\nHTTP REST, Feathers REST, Feathers WebSockets, or any other transport Feathers may support in the future.\nMost hooks can be used with any service.\nThis allows you to easily decouple the actual service logic from things like\nauthorization, data pre-processing (sanitizing and validating),\ndata post processing (serialization),\nor sending notifications like emails or text messages after something happened.\nYou can swap databases with minimal application code changes.\nYou can also share validations for multiple databases in the same app, across multiple apps,\nand with your client.\nResults\nThe browser console displays\ncreated Jane Doe item\n  Object {email: \"jane.doe@gmail.com\", role: \"admin\", createdAt:

an object or array for all method calls other than find.\nIt is an object if the find is paginated.\nOtherwise it is an array.\nThe hook function may either return synchronously or it may return a

returned.\nProTip Mutating the context param inside a hook function without returning it\ndoes not change the context object passed to the next hook.\n\nLet's review the source of some of the common hooks\nto learn how to write our own.\ndebug source\ndebug logs the context to the console.\nexport default function (msg) {\n  return context => {\n    console.log(`* ${msg ||

simply displaying some of the context object properties.\nThe context object does not change as the inner hook function returns undefined by default.\ndebug is great for debugging other hooks.\nOnce you place this hook before and after the hook under test,\nyou'll see the context object the test hook received, and what it returned.\nThis example\n\nShows several context properties.\nLeaves the context object unchanged with a sync return.\n\ndisableMultiItemChange source\ndisableMultiItemChange disables update, patch and remove methods from using null as an id,\ne.g. remove(null).\nA null id affects all the items in the DB, so accidentally using it may have undesirable results.\nimport errors from 'feathers-errors';\nimport checkContext from './check-context';\n\nexport default function

// { name: 'John', project: 'Feathers\n\nThis example\n\nShows how to call a service.\nShows how to deal with params in such calls.\nTalks about using getItems with mutations.\n\nstashBefore source\nstashBefore saves the current value of record before mutating it.\nimport errors from 'feathers-errors';\nimport checkContext from './check-context';\n\nexport default function (prop) {\n  const beforeField = prop || 'before';\n\n  return context => {\n    checkContext(context, 'before', ['get', 'update', 'patch', 'remove'], 'stashBefore');\n\n    if (context.id === null || context.id === undefined) {\n      throw new errors.BadRequest('Id is required. (stashBefore)');\n    }\n\n    if (context.params.query && context.params.query.$disableStashBefore) {\n      delete context.params.query.$disableStashBefore;\n      return context;\n    }\n\n    const params = (context.method === 'get') ? context.params : {\n      provider: context.params.provider,\n      authenticated: context.params.authenticated,\n      user: context.params.user\n    };\n\n    params.query = params.query || {};\n    params.query.$disableStashBefore = true;\n\n    return context.service.get(context.id, params)\n      .then(data => {\n        delete params.query.$disableStashBefore;\n\n        context.params[beforeField] = data;\n        return context;\n      })\n      .catch(() => context);\n  };\n}\n\nIts more complicated to call the hook's current service than to call another service.\nLet's look at some of the code in this hook.\nThis is what the hook returns.\nreturn context.service.get(context.id, params)\n  .then(data => {\n    delete params.query.$disableStashBefore;\n\n    context.params[beforeField] = data;\n    return context;\n  })\n  .catch(() => context);\n\n\ncontext.service is always the current service.\ncontext.service.get() is an async call, and it returns a Promise.\nThe hook returns that Promise, so its an async hook.\nThe next hook will only run once this Promise resolves.\nThe data obtained by the get is placed into context.params.\nWe can see the Promise will always resolve to context.\n\nIn summary, the hook will get the record being mutated by the call,\nwill place that record in context.params,\nand will return the possibly modified context.\nThe method call will continue as if nothing has happened.\nstashBefore does not use context.params in the get call\nas context.params may be inappropriate if, for example, you are using Sequelize\nand the method call includes parameters that are passed through to Sequelize.\nWhat may be appropriate for an update may not be acceptable for a get.\nconst params = context.method === 'get' ? context.params : {\n  provider: context.params.provider,\n  authenticated: context.params.authenticated,\n  user: context.params.user\n};\n\n\nOn a get call we will use the same params for our inner get.\nOn other calls, we use something \"safe\".\nWe copy over provider so our inner get acts like it has the same transport.\nWe copy standard authentication values for auth hooks.\n\n\n\nWill this satisfy every use case?\nNo, but it will satisfy most.\nYou can always fork the hook and customize it.\nThere is one more thing to consider.\nThe stashBefore hook will run again when we call the inner get.\nThis will cause a recursion of inner get calls unless we do something.\nif (context.params.query && context.params.query.$disableStashBefore) {\n  delete context.params.query.$disableStashBefore;\n  return context;\n}\n//\nparams.query = params.query || {};\nparams.query.$disableStashBefore = true;\n//\ndelete params.query.$disableStashBefore;\n\nWe set a flag to show we are calling the inner get.\nstashBefore will see the flag when it runs for that inner get and exit,\npreventing recursion.\n\nProTip Its not uncommon to indicate what state operations are in\nby setting flags in params.\n\nThis example\n\nShows how to call the current service.\nDiscusses how to handle params for service calls.\nShows how to prevent recursion.\n\niff, when, else\nConditional hooks like iff(predicate, hook1, hook2).else(hook3, hook4) can be very useful.\nIts easy to write your own predicates.\nThey are functions with a signature of context => boolean,\nwhich receive the context as a parameter and return either a boolean (synchronous)\nor a Promise which resolves to a boolean.\nYou can combine predicates provided with the common hooks, such as isProvider\n(source).\nYou can write your own, or mix and match.\niff (hook => !isProvider('service')(hook) && hook.params.user.security >= 3, ...)\n\nThe isNot conditional utility\n(source)\nis useful because it will negate either a boolean or a Promise resolving to a boolean.\nIs anything wrong, unclear,

means that services automatically send\ncreated, updated, patched and removed events when\na create, update, patch or remove service method is complete.\nClients can listen for these events and then react accordingly.\n\nThe client in a chat room app, for example,\ncould automatically receive all messages posted by any of the participants,\nand then display them.\nThis is much simpler than the traditional design pattern\nwhich requires long-polling of the server.\nAs another example, the client could maintain a local copy of\npart of a database table.\nIt can keep it up to date by listening to events for that table.\n\nReal-time. Real-time events are sent only to Feathers WebSocket clients.\nThey are not sent to Feathers REST nor HTTP REST clients.\nThese would have to implement a traditional long-polling design.\nConclusion: Use Feathers WebSocket clients.\n\nLet's create an event listener for the Feathers Websocket Client\nwe already have.\nWorking example\n\nServer code: examples/step/01/websocket/1.js\nListener code: common/public/listener.html\nand\nlistener-app.js\nClient code: common/public/socketio.html\nand\nfeathers-app.js\nStart the server: node ./examples/step/01/websocket/1.js\nStart the listener by pointing a browser tab at localhost:3030/listener.html\nStart making changes by pointing a browser tab at: localhost:3030/socketio.html\n\nImplementing a listener\nImplementing the listener\ncommon/public/listener-app.js\nis straight forward.\n\nconst users = feathersClient.service('/users');\n\nusers.on('created', user => console.log('created', user));\nusers.on('removed', user => console.log('removed', user));\n\nconsole.log('Listening for user events.');\n\nFiltering\nOur listener's console displays:\nListening for user events.\ncreated\n{email: \"jane.doe@gmail.com\", password: \"11111\", role: \"admin\", _id: \"qyRMR6abq8RHV29R\"}\ncreated\n{email: \"john.doe@gmail.com\", password: \"22222\", role: \"user\", _id: \"XI6e3bZcoupb6Hyr\"}\ncreated\n{email: \"judy.doe@gmail.com\", password: \"33333\", role: \"user\", _id: \"qeYSi2KrkwIUMoaE\"}\n\nYou usually wouldn't want to send passwords to clients.\nIn many cases you probably want to be able to send certain events to certain clients,\nsay maybe only ones that are authenticated.\nThe server can control what data is sent to which clients with\nevent filters.\n\nFor example, we could send users events only to authenticated users\nand remove password from the payload by adding this to the server code:\nconst users = app.service('users');\nusers.filter((data, connection) => {\n  delete data.password;\n  return connection.user ? data : false;\n});\n\nIs anything wrong, unclear, missing?\nLeave a

Update public/index.html to look like this:\n\n  \n    \n    \n    Feathers Chat\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nConnecting to the API\nNow we can create public/app.js with the following Feathers client setup:\nconst socket = io();\nconst client = feathers();\nclient.configure(feathers.hooks());\n\n// Create the Feathers application with a `socketio` connection\nclient.configure(feathers.socketio(socket));\n\n// Get the service for our `messages` endpoint\nconst messages = client.service('messages');\n\n// Log when anyone creates a new message in real-time!\nmessages.on('created', message =>\n  alert(`New message from ${message.name}: ${message.text}`)\n);\n\n// Create a test message\nmessages.create({\n  name: 'Test user',\n  text: 'Hello world!'\n});\n\nmessages.find().then(page => console.log('Current messages are', page));\n\nThis will connect to our API server using Socket.io, send a test message and also listen to any new message in real-time showing it in an alert window when going to the page at localhost:3030. Once you have created the message you can also see that it showed up in the localhost:3030/messages endpoint.\n\nNote: The feathers namespace is added by the browser build and io is available through the socket.io/socket.io.js script. For more information on using Feathers in the browser and with a module loader like Webpack or Browserify see the client chapter.\n\nSending and displaying messages\nAlright. We can create and listen to new messages and also list all messages. All that is left to do now is create some HTML from the message list and a form to create new messages. Let's update public/index.html with some HTML for our chat to look like this:\n\n  \n    \n    \n    Feathers Chat\n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            Chat\n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n\n            \n              \n              \n              Send\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nThen we can update public/app.js with the functionality to get, show and send messages like this:\nconst socket = io();\nconst client = feathers();\n\n// Create the Feathers application with a `socketio` connection\nclient.configure(feathers.socketio(socket));\n\n// Get the service for our `messages` endpoint\nconst messages = client.service('messages');\n\n// Add a new message to the list\nfunction addMessage(message) {\n  const chat = document.querySelector('.chat');\n\n  chat.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', `\n    \n    \n      \n        ${message.name}\n      \n      ${message.text}\n    \n  `);\n\n  chat.scrollTop = chat.scrollHeight - chat.clientHeight;\n}\n\nmessages.find().then(page => page.data.forEach(addMessage));\nmessages.on('created', addMessage);\n\ndocument.getElementById('send-message').addEventListener('submit', function(ev) {\n  const nameInput = document.querySelector('[name=\"name\"]');\n  // This is the message text input field\n  const textInput = document.querySelector('[name=\"text\"]');\n\n  // Create a new message and then clear the input field\n  client.service('messages').create({\n    text: textInput.value,\n    name: nameInput.value\n  }).then(() => {\n    textInput.value = '';\n  });\n  ev.preventDefault();\n});\n\nIf you now open localhost:3030 you can see an input field for your name and the message which will show up in other browsers in real-time.\nWhat's next?\nIn this chapter we looked at how to use Feathers on the client and created a simple real-time chat application frontend to show and send messages. In the next chapters we will move back to the server and add authentication and learn about processing data.\nIs anything wrong, unclear, missing?\nLeave a comment.\n"},"guides/chat/authentication.html":{"url":"guides/chat/authentication.html","title":"Adding authentication","keywords":"","body":"Adding authentication\nIn the previous chapters we created our Feathers chat application and initialized a service for storing messages. We also build a simple real-time frontend for the browser. However, for a proper chat application we need to be able to register and authenticate users.\nGenerating authentication\nTo add authentication to our application we can run\nfeathers generate authentication\nThis will first ask us which authentication providers we would like to use. In this guide we will only cover local authentication so let's select the first entry using the Space key and then confirm the selection with enter.\nNext we have to define the service we would like to use to store user information. Here we can just confirm the default users and the database with the default NeDB:\n\nCreating a user and logging in\nWe just created a users service and enabled local authentication. When restarting the application we can now create a new user with email and password similar to what we did with messages and then use the login information to get a JWT (for more information see the How JWT works guide).\nCreating the user\nWe will create a new user with the following data:\n{\n  \"email\": \"feathers@example.com\",\n  \"password\": \"secret\"\n}\nThe generated user service will automatically securely hash the password in the database for us and also exclude it from the response (passwords should never be transmitted). There are several ways to create a new user, for example via CURL like this:\ncurl 'http://localhost:3030/users/' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{ \"email\": \"feathers@example.com\", \"password\": \"secret\" }'\nWith a REST client, e.g. Postman using this button:\n\nOr via the client we used in the frontend chapter by adding the following to public/app.js:\n// Create a test new user\nclient.service('users').create({\n  email: 'feathers@example.com',\n  password: 'secret'\n});\n\n\nNote: Creating a user with the same email address will only work once and fail when it already exists in the database.\n\nGetting a token\nTo create a JWT we can now post the login information with the strategy we want to use (local) to the authentication service:\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"local\",\n  \"email\": \"feathers@example.com\",\n  \"password\": \"secret\"\n}\nVia CURL:\ncurl 'http://localhost:3030/authentication/' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{ \"strategy\": \"local\", \"email\": \"feathers@example.com\", \"password\": \"secret\" }'\nWith a REST client, e.g. Postman:\n\nThe returned token can now be used to authenticate the user it was created for by adding it to the Authorization header of new HTTP requests.\nThe Feathers client from the frontend chapter already has authentication (and storing the generated token in LocalStorage) built in and can be used by adding this to public/app.js:\nclient.configure(feathers.authentication({\n  storage: window.localStorage\n}));\n\nclient.authenticate({\n  strategy: 'local',\n  email: 'feathers@example.com',\n  password: 'secret'\n}).then(token => {\n  console.log('User is logged in');\n});\n\nThen we can update public/app.js to look like this:\nconst socket = io();\nconst client = feathers();\n\n// Create the Feathers application with a `socketio` connection\nclient.configure(feathers.socketio(socket));\n\n// Get the service for our `messages` endpoint\nconst messages = client.service('messages');\n\n// Configure authentication\nclient.configure(feathers.authentication({\n  storage: window.localStorage\n}));\n\nclient.authenticate({\n  strategy: 'local',\n  email: 'feathers@example.com',\n  password: 'secret'\n}).then((token) => {\n  console.log('User is logged in', token);\n\n  // At this point we have a valid token, so we can fetch restricted data.\n  messages.find().then(page => page.data.forEach(addMessage));\n  messages.on('created', addMessage);\n});\n\n// Add a new message to the list\nfunction addMessage(message) {\n  const chat = document.querySelector('.chat');\n\n  chat.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', `\n    \n    \n      \n        ${message.name}\n      \n      ${message.text}\n    \n  `);\n\n  chat.scrollTop = chat.scrollHeight - chat.clientHeight;\n}\n\ndocument.getElementById('send-message').addEventListener('submit', function(ev) {\n  const nameInput = document.querySelector('[name=\"name\"]');\n  // This is the message text input field\n  const textInput = document.querySelector('[name=\"text\"]');\n\n  // Create a new message and then clear the input field\n  client.service('messages').create({\n    text: textInput.value,\n    name: nameInput.value\n  }).then(() => {\n    textInput.value = '';\n  });\n  ev.preventDefault();\n});\n\nSecuring the messages service\nNow we have to restrict our messages service to authenticated users. If we run feathers generate authentication before generating other services it will ask if the service should be restricted to authenticated users. Because we created the messages service first, however we have to update src/services/messages/messages.hooks.js manually to look like this:\nconst { authenticate } = require('feathers-authentication').hooks;\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  before: {\n    all: [ authenticate('jwt') ],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  },\n\n  after: {\n    all: [],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  },\n\n  error: {\n    all: [],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  }\n};\n\nThis will now only allow users with a valid JWT to access the service.\nWhat's next?\nIn this chapter we initialized authentication and created a user and JWT. We can now use that user information to process new message data.\nIs anything wrong, unclear, missing?\nLeave a comment.\n"},"guides/chat/processing.html":{"url":"guides/chat/processing.html","title":"Processing data","keywords":"","body":"Processing data\nNow that we can create and authenticate users, we are going to process data, sanitize the input we get from the client and add additional information.\nSanitizing new message\nWhen creating a new message, we automatically want to sanitize HTML input, add the user that sent it and include the date the message has been created before saving it in the database. This is where hooks come into play, in our case specifically a before hook. To create a new hook we can run:\nfeathers generate hook\nThe hook we want to create will be called process-message. Since we want to pre-process our data, the next prompt asking for what kind of hook, we will choose before from the list.\nNext we will see a list of all our services we can add this hook to. For this hook we will only choose the messages service (navigate to the entry with the arrow keys and select it with the space key).\nA hook can run before any number of service methods, for this one we will only select create. After confirming the last prompt we will see something like this:\n\nThis will create our hook and wire it up to the service we selected. Now it is time to add some code. Update src/hooks/process-message.js to look like this:\n'use strict';\n\n// Use this hook to manipulate incoming or outgoing data.\n// For more information on hooks see: http://docs.feathersjs.com/api/hooks.html\n\nmodule.exports = function() {\n  return function(hook) {\n    // The authenticated user\n    const user = hook.params.user;\n    // The actual message text\n    const text = hook.data.text\n      // Messages can't be longer than 400 characters\n      .substring(0, 400)\n      // Do some basic HTML escaping\n      .replace(/&/g,'&amp;').replace(//g,'&gt;');\n\n    // Override the original data\n    hook.data = {\n      text,\n      // Set the user id\n      userId: user._id,\n      // Add the current time via `getTime`\n      createdAt: new Date().getTime()\n    };\n\n    // Hooks can either return nothing or a promise\n    // that resolves with the `hook` object for asynchronous operations\n    return Promise.resolve(hook);\n  };\n};\n\nThis will do several things:\n\nTruncate the messages text property to 400 characters and do some basic HTML escaping.\nUpdate the data submitted to the database to contain\nThe new truncated and sanitized text\nThe currently authenticated user (so we always know who sent it)\nThe current (creation) date \n\n\nReturn a Promise that resolves with the hook object (this is what any hook should return)\n\nAdding a user avatar\nLet's create one more hook that adds a link to the Gravatar image of the users email address so we can show an avatar. After running\nfeathers generate hook\nThe selections are almost the same as our previous hook:\n\nThe hook will be called gravatar\nIt will be a before hook\nOn the users service\nFor the create method\n\n\nThen we update src/hooks/gravatar.js with the following code:\n'use strict';\n\n// Use this hook to manipulate incoming or outgoing data.\n// For more information on hooks see: http://docs.feathersjs.com/api/hooks.html\n\n// We need this to create the MD5 hash\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\n\n// The Gravatar image service\nconst gravatarUrl = 'https://s.gravatar.com/avatar';\n// The size query. Our chat needs 60px images\nconst query = 's=60';\n\nmodule.exports = function() {\n  return function(hook) {\n    // The user email\n    const { email } = hook.data;\n    // Gravatar uses MD5 hashes from an email address to get the image\n    const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(email).digest('hex');\n\n    hook.data.avatar = `${gravatarUrl}/${hash}?${query}`;\n\n    // Hooks can either return nothing or a promise\n    // that resolves with the `hook` object for asynchronous operations\n    return Promise.resolve(hook);\n  };\n};\n\nHere we use Node's crypto library to create an MD5 hash of the users email address. This is what Gravatar uses as the URL for the avatar of an email address. If we now create a new user it will add the link to the image in the gravatar property.\nPopulating the message sender\nIn the process-message hook we are currently just storing the users _id in the message. We want to show more than the _id in the UI, so we'll need to populate more data in the message response. In order to show the right user information we want to include that information in our messages.\nWe could do this by creating our own hook but adding related entities is quite common and already implement in the populate common hook. In order to use the hook we have to update the src/services/messages/messages.hooks.js file to look like this:\n'use strict';\n\nconst { authenticate } = require('feathers-authentication').hooks;\nconst { populate } = require('feathers-hooks-common');\nconst processMessage = require('../../hooks/process-message');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  before: {\n    all: [ authenticate('jwt') ],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [ processMessage() ],\n    update: [ processMessage() ],\n    patch: [ processMessage() ],\n    remove: []\n  },\n\n  after: {\n    all: [\n      populate({\n        schema: {\n          include: [{\n            service: 'users',\n            nameAs: 'user',\n            parentField: 'userId',\n            childField: '_id'\n          }]\n        }\n      })\n    ],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  },\n\n  error: {\n    all: [],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  }\n};\n\nThis will include the user property using the userId, retrieving it from the users service to all messages.\nYou can learn more about how the populate hook works by checking out the API docs for feathers-hooks-common.\nWhat's next?\nIn this section we added three hooks to pre- and postprocess our message and user data. We now have a complete API to send and retrieve messages including authentication.\nSee the frameworks section for more resources on specific frameworks like React, React Native, Angular or VueJS.  You'll find guides for creating a complete chat frontend with signup, logging, user listing and messages.

The new plugins are very flexible, allowing you to customize nearly everything.  This flexibility required making some changes.  In this guide, we'll look at the changes to the login response and how you can customize it.\nChanges to the Login Response\nThe previous version of feathers-authentication always returned the same response.  It looked something like this:\n{\n  token: '',\n  user: {\n    id: 1,\n    email: 'my@email.com'\n  }\n}\n\nThe JWT also contained a payload which held an id property representing the user id.  We found that this was too restrictive for some of our more technical apps.  For instance, what if you wanted to authenticate a device instead of a user?  Or what if you want to authenticate both a device and a user?  The old plugin couldn't handle those situations.  The new one does.  To make it work, we started by simplifying the response.  The default response now looks like this:\n{\n  accessToken: ''\n}\n\nThe JWT also contains a payload which has a userId property.  \nBased on the above, you can see that we still authenticate a user by default.  In this case, the user is what we call the entity.  It's the generic name of what is being authenticated.  It's customizable, but that's not covered in this guide.  Instead, let's focus on what it takes to add the user in the login response.\nCustomizing the Login Response\nThe /authentication endpoint is now a Feathers service.  It uses the create method for login and the remove method for logout.  Just like with all Feathers services, you can customize the response with the hook API.  For what we want to do, the important part is the hook.result, which becomes the response body.  We can use an after hook to customize the hook.result to return anything that we want:\napp.service('/authentication').hooks({\n  after: {\n    create: [\n      hook => {\n        hook.result.foo = 'bar';\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nAfter a successful login, the hook.result already contains the accessToken.  The above example modified the response to look like this:\n{\n  accessToken: '',\n  foo: 'bar'\n}\n\nAccessing the User Entity\nLet's see how to include the user in the response, as was done in previous versions.  The /authentication service modifies the hook.params object to contain the entity object (in this case, the user).  With that information, you might have already figured out how to get the user into the response.  It just has to be copied from hook.params.user to the hook.result.user:\napp.service('/authentication').hooks({\n  after: {\n    create: [\n      hook => {\n        hook.result.user = hook.params.user;\n\n        // Don't expose sensitive information.\n        delete hook.result.user.password;\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nAt this point, the response now includes the accessToken and the user.  Now the client won't have to make an additional request for the user data.  As is shown in the above example, be sure to not expose any sensitive information.\nWrapping Up\nYou've now learned some of the differences in the new feathers-authentication plugin.  Instead of using two endpoints, it's using a single service.  It also has a simplified response, compared to before.  Now, you can customize the response to include whatever information you need.\n"},"guides/auth/recipe.customize-jwt-payload.html":{"url":"guides/auth/recipe.customize-jwt-payload.html","title":"Recipe: Custom JWT Payload","keywords":"","body":"FeathersJS Auth Recipe: Customizing the JWT Payload\nThe Auk release of FeathersJS includes a powerful new authentication suite built on top of PassportJS.  The new plugins are very flexible, allowing you to customize nearly everything.  One feature added in the latest release is the ability to customize the JWT payload using hooks.  Let's take a look at what this means, how to make it work, and learn about the potential pitfalls you may encounter by using it.\nThe JWT Payload\nIf you read the resources on how JWT works, you'll know that a JWT is an encoded string that can contain a payload.  For a quick example, check out the Debugger on jwt.io.  The purple section on jwt.io is the payload.  You'll also notice that you can put arbitrary data in the payload.  The payload data gets encoded as the section section of the JWT string.\nThe default JWT payload contains the following claims:\nconst decode = require('jwt-decode')\n// Retrieve the token from wherever you've stored it.\nconst jwt = window.localStorage.getItem('feathers-jwt')\nconst payload = decode(jwt)\n\npayload === {\n  aud: 'https://yourdomain.com', // audience\n  exp: 23852348347, // expires at time\n  iat: 23852132232, // issued at time\n  iss: 'feathers', // issuer\n  sub: 'anonymous', // subject\n  userId: 1 // the user's id\n}\n\nNotice that the payload is encoded and IS NOT ENCRYPTED.  It's an important difference.  It means that you want to be careful what you store in the JWT payload.\nCustomizing the Payload with Hooks\nThe authentication services uses the params.payload object in the hook context for the JWT payload.  This means you can customize the JWT by adding a before hook after the authenticate hook.\napp.service('authentication').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      authentication.hooks.authenticate(config.strategies),\n\n      // This hook adds the `test` attribute to the JWT payload by\n      // modifying params.payload.\n      hook => {\n        // make sure params.payload exists\n        hook.params.payload = hook.params.payload || {}\n        // merge in a `test` property\n        Object.assign(hook.params.payload, {test: 'test'})\n      }\n    ],\n    remove: [\n      authentication.hooks.authenticate('jwt')\n    ]\n  }\n})\n\nNow the payload will contain the test attribute:\nconst decode = require('jwt-decode')\n// Retrieve the token from wherever you've stored it.\nconst jwt = window.localStorage.getItem('feathers-jwt')\nconst payload = decode(jwt)\n\npayload === {\n  aud: 'https://yourdomain.com',\n  exp: 23852348347,\n  iat: 23852132232,\n  iss: 'feathers',\n  sub: 'anonymous',\n  userId: 1\n  test: true // Here's the new claim we just added\n}\n\nImportant Security Information\nAs you add data to the JWT payload the token size gets larger.  Try it out on jwt.io to see for yourself.   There is an important security issue to keep in mind when customizing the payload.  This issue involves the default HS256 algorithm used to sign the token.\nWith HS256, there is a relationship between the length of the secret (which must be a minimum of 256-bits) and the length of the encoded token (which varies with the payload).  A larger secret-to-payload ratio (so the secret is larger than the JWT) will result in a more secure JWT.  This also means that keeping the secret size the same and increasing the payload size will actually make your JWT comparatively less secure.\nThe Feathers generator creates a 2048-bit secret, by default, so there is a small amount of allowable space for putting additional attributes in the JWT payload.  It's very important to keep the secret-to-payload length ratio as high as possible to avoid brute force attacks.  In a brute force attack, the attacker attempts to retrieve the secret by guessing the secret over and over until getting it right.  If your secret is compromised, they will be able to create signed JWT with whatever payload they wish.  In short, be cautious about what you put in your JWT payload.\nFinally, remember that the secret created by the generator is meant for development purposes, only.  You never want to check your production secret into your version control system (Git, etc.).  It is best to put your production secret in an environment variable and reference it in the app configuration.\n"},"guides/auth/recipe.mixed-auth.html":{"url":"guides/auth/recipe.mixed-auth.html","title":"Recipe: Mixed Auth Endpoints","keywords":"","body":"FeathersJS Auth Recipe: Create Endpoints with Mixed Auth\nThe Auk release of FeathersJS includes a powerful new authentication suite built on top of PassportJS.

For this example, we‚Äôll use the /users service that was already created by the authentication generator. Let‚Äôs suppose that our application requires that each user record will contain a public boolean property. Each record will look something like this:\n{\n  id: 1,\n  email: 'my@email.com'\n  password: \"password\",\n  public: true\n}\n\nIf a user record contains public: true, then unauthenticated users should be able to access it. Let‚Äôs see how to use the iff and else conditional hooks from feathers-hooks-common to make this happen. Be sure to read the iff hook API docs and else hook API docs if you haven‚Äôt, yet.\nWe‚Äôre going to use the iff hook to authenticate users only if a token is in the request. The feathers-authentication-jwt plugin, which we used in src/authentication.js, includes a token extractor. If a request includes a token, it will automatically be available inside the hook object at hook.params.token.\nsrc/services/users/users.hooks.js\n(This example only shows the find method's before hooks.)\n'use strict';\n\nconst { authenticate } = require('feathers-authentication').hooks;\nconst commonHooks = require('feathers-hooks-common');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  before: {\n    find: [\n      // If a token was included, authenticate it with the `jwt` strategy.\n      commonHooks.iff(\n        hook => hook.params.token,\n        authenticate('jwt')\n      // No token was found, so limit the query to include `public: true`\n      ).else( hook => Object.assign(hook.params.query, { public: true }) )\n    ]\n  }\n};\n\nLet‚Äôs break down the above example. We setup the find method of the /users service with an iff conditional before hook:\niff(\n  hook => hook.params.token,\n  authenticate(‚Äòjwt‚Äô)\n)\n\nFor this application, the above snippet is equivalent to the snippet, below.\nhook => {\n  if (hook.params.token) {\n    return authenticate(‚Äòjwt‚Äô)\n  } else {\n    return Promise.resolve(hook)\n  }\n}\n\nThe iff hook is actually more capable than the simple demonstration, above. It can handle an async predicate expression. This would be equivalent to being able to pass a promise inside the if statement's parentheses. It also allows us to chain an .else() statement, which will run if the predicate evaluates to false.\n.else( hook => Object.assign(hook.params.query, { public: true }) )\n\nThe above statement simply adds public: true to the query parameters. This limits the query to only find user records that have the public property set to true.\nWrapping Up\nWith the above code, we‚Äôve successfully setup a /users service that responds differently to unauthenticated and authenticated users. We used the hook.params.token attribute to either authenticate a user or to limit the search query to only public users. If you become familiar with the Common Hooks API, you‚Äôll be able to solve almost any authentication puzzle.\n"},"guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.html":{"url":"guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.html","title":"Recipe: Basic OAuth","keywords":"","body":"FeathersJS Auth Recipe: Set up Basic OAuth Login\nThe Auk release of FeathersJS includes a powerful new authentication suite built on top of PassportJS.  This now gives the Feathers community access to hundreds of authentication strategies from the Passport community.  Since many of the Passport strategies are for OAuth, we've created two auth plugins, feathers-authentication-oauth1 and feathers-authentication-oauth2.  These new plugins use a Passport strategy to allow OAuth logins into your app.\nAdding OAuth authentication to your app is a great way to quickly allow users to login.  It allows the user to use an existing Internet account with another service to login to your app.  Among lots of good reasons, it often eliminates the need for the email address verification dance.  This is even more likely for very common OAuth providers, like GitHub, Google, and Facebook.\nSimplified login is almost always a good idea, but for many developers implementing OAuth can be difficult.  Let's take a look at how it works, in general.  After that, we'll see how the new feathers-authentication server plugin makes it easy to get up and running.\nHow OAuth Works\nThere are a couple of different methods you can use to implement OAuth. Here are the basic steps of the flow that the feathers-authentication-oauth1 and feathers-authentication-oauth2 plugins use.\n\nYou register your application with the OAuth Provider.  This includes giving the provider a callback URL (more on this later). The provider will give you an app identifier and an app secret.  The secret is basically a special password for your app.\nYou direct the user's browser to the OAuth provider's site, providing the app identifier in the query string.\nThe content provider uses the app identifier to retrieve information about your app.  That information is then presented to the user with a login form.  The user can grant or deny access to your application.\nUpon making a decision, the provider redirects the user's browser to the callback URL you setup in the first step. It includes a short-lived authorization code in the querystring.\nYour server sends a request to the OAuth provider's server.  It includes the authorization code and the secret.  If the authorization code and secret are valid, the provider returns an OAuth access token to your server.  Some user data can also be sent.\nYour server can save the user information into the /users table.  It can also use this access token to make requests to the provider's API.  This same information can also be sent to the browser for use.\nWith Feathers, there is an additional step.  After logging in, a JWT access token is stored in a cookie and sent to the browser.  The client uses the JWT to authenticate with the server on subsequent requests.\n\nImplementing OAuth with Feathers\nThe Feathers-cli allows you to easily setup a new application with OAuth.  Here are the steps to generate an application:\n\nnpm install -g feathers-cli\nor \nyarn global feathers-cli\nmkdir feathers-demo-oauth; cd feathers-demo-oauth\nor a folder name you prefer.\nfeathers generate app\nuse the default prompts.\nfeathers generate authentication\nSelect Facebook, GitHub, or Google when prompted for a provider.\nThis guide will show how to use GitHub.\nSelect the defaults for the remaining prompts.\n\n\n\nSetting up the OAuth Provider\nTo setup the provider, you use each provider's website.  Here are links to common providers:\n\nFacebook\nGitHub\nGoogle\n\nOnce your app is setup, the OAuth provider will give you a Client ID and Client Secret.\nConfiguring Your Application\nOnce you have your app's Client ID and Client Secret, it's time to setup the app to communicate with the provider.  Open the default.json configuration file.  The generator added a key to the config for the provider you selected.  The below configuration example has a github config.  Copy over and replace the placeholders with the clientID and clientSecret.\nconfig/default.json\n{\n  \"host\": \"localhost\",\n  \"port\": 3030,\n  \"public\": \"../public/\",\n  \"paginate\": {\n    \"default\": 10,\n    \"max\": 50\n  },\n  \"authentication\": {\n    \"secret\": \"cc71e4f97a80c878491197399aabf74e9c0b115c9f8071e75b306c99c891a54b7171852f8c5508e1fe4dcfaedbb603178b0935261928592e487e628f2f669f3a752f2beb3661b29d521b36c8a39e1be6823c0362df5ef1e212d7f2daae789df1065293b98ec9b43309ffe24dba3a2ec2362c5ce5c9155c6438ec380bc7c56d6a169988c0f6754077c5129e8a0ee5fd85b2182d87f84312387e1bbefebe49ad1bf2dcf783e7d8cbee40272b141358b8e23150eee5ea8fc04b2a0f3d824e7fa9d46c025c619c3281af91b7a19fd760bccedae379b735c85024b25a9c91749935b2f29d5b69b2c1ff29368b4aa9cf426d9960302e5e7b903d53e18ccbe2325cf3b6\",\n    \"strategies\": [\n      \"jwt\"\n    ],\n    \"path\": \"/authentication\",\n    \"service\": \"users\",\n    \"jwt\": {\n      \"header\": {\n        \"type\": \"access\"\n      },\n      \"audience\": \"https://yourdomain.com\",\n      \"subject\": \"anonymous\",\n      \"issuer\": \"feathers\",\n      \"algorithm\": \"HS256\",\n      \"expiresIn\": \"1d\"\n    },\n    \"github\": {\n      \"clientID\": \"your github client id\", // Replace this with your app's Client ID\n      \"clientSecret\": \"your github client secret\", // Replace this with your app's Client Secret\n      \"successRedirect\": \"/\"\n    },\n    \"cookie\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"name\": \"feathers-jwt\",\n      \"httpOnly\": false,\n      \"secure\": false\n    }\n  },\n  \"nedb\": \"../data\"\n}\n\nTest Login with OAuth\nYour app is ready for OAuth logins.  We've made it that simple!  Let's try it out.  Open the file public/index.html and scroll to the bottom.  Add the following code just under the h2:\n\n  Login With GitHub\n\n\nNow add the following code to the same page.  The first script tag loads Feathers Client from a CDN.  The second script loads Socket.io.  The third script creates a Feathers Client instance and attempts to authenticate with the JWT strategy upon page load.  The authentication client plugin has been configured with a cookie value of feathers-jwt.\n\nNote: This code loads the feathers-client package from a CDN.  This is not the recommended usage for most apps, but is good for demonstration purposes.  We recommend using a bundler as described in the Feathers Client API docs.\n\n\n\n\n  // Socket.io is exposed as the `io` global.\n  var socket = io('http://localhost:3030', {transports: ['websocket']});\n  // feathers-client is exposed as the `feathers` global.\n  var feathersClient = feathers()\n    .configure(feathers.hooks())\n    .configure(feathers.socketio(socket))\n    .configure(feathers.authentication({\n      cookie: 'feathers-jwt'\n    }));\n\n  feathersClient.authenticate()\n    .then(response => {\n      console.info('Feathers Client has Authenticated with the JWT access token!');\n      console.log(response);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.info('We have not logged in with OAuth, yet.  This means there\\'s no cookie storing the accessToken.  As a result, feathersClient.authenticate() failed.');\n      console.log(error);\n    });\n\n\nNow, run the server, open http://localhost:3030.  Before you click the button, open the console.  If you refresh you'll see the message in the catch block.  Since we haven't logged in, yet, we don't have a stored JWT access token.  Now, click the Login with GitHub button.  Assuming you haven't logged in to Github with this application, before, you'll see a GitHub login page.  Once you login to GitHub, you'll be redirected back to http://localhost:3030.  Now, if you look at your console, you should see a success message.\nWhat just happened?  When you clicked on that link, it opened the /auth/github link, which is just a shortcut for redirecting to GitHub with your Client ID.  The entire OAuth process that we described earlier took place.  The browser received a feathers-jwt cookie from the server.  Finally the script that we added in the last step used the feathers-authentication-client to authenticate using the JWT returned from the server.  There were a lot of steps that happened in a very short time.  The best news is that you're authenticated with OAuth.\nWrapping Up\nYou've now seen how OAuth login is greatly simplified with the new Feathers Authentication plugins.  Having plugins built on top of PassportJS allows for a lot of flexibility.  You can now build nearly any authentication experience imaginable.  In the final part of this guide, you were able to authenticate the Feathers client.  Hopefully this will get you started integrating OAuth into your application.\n"},"guides/offline-first/readme.html":{"url":"guides/offline-first/readme.html","title":"Offline first","keywords":"","body":"Offline-first\nThe Landscape\nCustomers are increasingly purchasing goods and services using smartphones, either through native or web applications. And, they want to make these purchases wherever they may be, whether it‚Äôs inside trains, in the countryside or roaming in foreign countries.\nHowever, mobile networks are still known to be unreliable. Even in highly covered areas and with modern networks, you still encounter high latency and network failure rates. But it‚Äôs not just the network at fault here: the customer experience for failure rates also depends on how a given application deals with being offline.\nIn one extreme end of the quality spectrum, you have an application that, when a network error occurs, the application presents the user with a crude error message and no clue of how to recover.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum are applications that automatically deal with network failures ‚Äî this is the good end of the spectrum.\n\n(*)\nWhat is Offline-first?\nOffline-first is a way of building applications where having network connectivity is an enhancement, not a necessity. Instead of building applications with the always-on desktop mindset, when you build applications in which the default mode is offline, you‚Äôre prone to deliver a better overall customer experience.\nOffline-first techniques and technologies exist to prepare an application to deliver a good experience to customers while it‚Äôs offline.\n(*)\nClient has Local Data\nThe only way that an application can access data while it‚Äôs offline is, of course, to store that data locally.\nYour application prefers reading from the local source, while that local data is updated from remote sources.\nThe First Generation of Offline-first (*)\nSome database technologies exist that work on the client side. SQLite is the reference of embeddable databases and it‚Äôs often used on native applications. In the web realm, PouchDB offers a document store on top of the storage the browser offers. PouchDB also has some nice features ‚Äî  it can sync with a back-end CouchDB server, Cloudant, a PouchDB Node.js server or any other database that implements the CouchDB replication protocol.\nIn this architecture, each client has its own dedicated database, which is then replicated to a dedicated database on the back-end. Each database may then contain the customer documents. (A document is a JSON object that may contain any arbitrary data).\nOne database per customer may sound strange to people who are used to relational databases, but it‚Äôs a usual pattern when using CouchDB and variants. It‚Äôs also a way to clearly and naturally separate and enforce which data a user has access to.\nWhen a change happens on the client or on the server, the sync protocol kicks in and tries to replicate that change to the other side. If no network connection is possible at that time, the client will try to reconnect. Once a connection is possible, both databases will be able to talk to each other and synchronize.\nIn this architecture, both the client and the server can make changes to the data concurrently. If a conflict arises for a given document, the replication protocol makes sure that both databases converge to the same version of that document. When a conflict happens, Pouch and CouchDB keep all the conflict data around. If the programmer so wishes, they can solve that conflict with any strategy they deem correct and that minimizes data loss.\n(*)\nIssues\nOne database per customer is logically reasonable for many mobile applications as customers don't interact in such applications.\nHowever a successful application may end up having thousands of databases, one for each of its thousands of customers.\nYou can use tools, such as those provided by IBM, which maintain only one database but makes it look like many individual CouchDB databases.\nA second issue is that the remote and local databases synchronize by replication.\nThe only way to make replication realtime is to start a synchronization cycle every time any data changes on either the remote of the local database.\nThis is overhead to consider even when you have one database per client.\nWhen the same data is shared by clients, providing realtime updates to all of them is problematic, \nas a replication cycle is needed for each client.\nFeathers Offline-first\nFeathers has unique foundational features which are useful for implementing offline-first.\nFirst, local applications can easily mutate remote databases.\nThis means we can add a hook to a local database so that, whenever it is locally mutated, the hook can optimistically mutate the remote database.\n\nSecond, local applications know when a remote database is mutated as that mutation emits a Feathers realtime event on the client.\n\nFeathers offline-first therefore reacts in realtime when connected, employing a replication strategy only when disconnected.\nThis makes applications using it less sluggish.\nImportantly, Feathers offline-first allows a client database to reflect only a portion of the remote database.\nSo information for all customers can reside in one database, with each client seeing only those items its allowed to.\nNo universal solution\nThere is no one universal solution to implementing offline-first. The end.\nFor each application, you have to:\n\nassess the problem\ndetermine the correct solution\nimplement the right code\n\n\nIn this order please!\n\nMany mobile applications only need a read-only local database which is infrequently refreshed.\nWhy would you implement a complex replication strategy in such cases?\nFeathers offline-first provides several strategies for implementing offline-first.\nDetermine your application's needs and then choose the simplest strategy which satisfies them.\nSources:\n\n(*) Pedro Teixeira\n\n"},"guides/offline-first/strategies.html":{"url":"guides/offline-first/strategies.html","title":"Strategies","keywords":"","body":"Strategies\nComparison of Strategies\nFeathers offline-first provides several increasingly sophisticated strategies.\nIts generally straightforward to change your application to use a more sophisticated one (except for snapshot).\n\nProTip: The snapshot, realtime, and realtime with optimistic mutation strategies are available at this time.\n\nThe features for each strategy are shown below.\n\n\n\nFeature...................\nsnap shot\nreal time\noptimistic mutation\nown-data own-net\nsync-data sync-net\ntime-travel\n\n\n\n\nReplicate partial table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- using query syntax\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\n- using JS functions\n-\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\nSnapshot data on connect\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\nIs a uuid(1) field required?\n-\n-\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote changes mutate client\n-\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\n- minimal service events\n-\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClient can mutate remote data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- with remote service calls\n-\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\n- optimistic client mutation\n-\n\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\nKeep queue while disconnected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Keep every call\n-\n-\n-\nown-data\nsync-data\n\n\n\n- Only record net change\n-\n-\n-\nown-net\nsync-net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess queue on reconnection\n-\n-\n-\nY\nY\n\n\n\n- Conflict resolution handling\n-\n-\n-\n-\nY\n\n\n\nSnapshot data on reconnect\n-\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\ntba\ntba\ntba\ntba\n\n\n\n\n(1) Universally unique identifier (uuid)\n(2) feathers-offline-snapshot\n(3) feathers-offline-realtime\n(4) feathers-offline-realtime with /optimistic-mutator\n\n"},"guides/offline-first/snapshot.html":{"url":"guides/offline-first/snapshot.html","title":"Snapshot","keywords":"","body":"Snapshot\nWhat is the Snapshot strategy?\nSnapshot distributes data exactly as it appears at a specific moment in time and does not monitor for updates to the data.\nWhen synchronization occurs, the entire snapshot is generated and sent to client service.\n\nSnapshot can be used by itself, but the snapshot process is also commonly used to provide the initial set of data for all the other strategies.\n\nUsing Snapshot by itself is most appropriate when one or more of the following is true:\n\nData changes infrequently.\nIt is acceptable to have copies of data that are out of date with respect to the remote service for a period of time.\nReplicating small or medium volumes of data.\nA large volume of changes occurs over a short period of time.\nKeep the current values after having lost connection for some time.\n\nSnapshot replication is most appropriate when data changes are substantial but infrequent.\nFor example, if a sales organization maintains a product price list and the prices are all updated at the same time once or twice each year,\nreplicating the entire snapshot of data after it has changed is recommended.\nGiven certain types of data, more frequent snapshots may also be appropriate.\nFor example, if a relatively small table is updated on a remote service during the day,\nbut some latency is acceptable, changes can be delivered nightly as a snapshot.\nSnapshot has a lower continuous overhead on both the client and the remote than the other strategies,\nbecause incremental changes are not tracked.\nHowever, if the dataset set is very large,\nit will require substantial resources to generate and apply the snapshot.\nConsider the size of the entire data set and the frequency of changes to the data when evaluating whether to utilize snapshot replication.\n(*)\nSnapshot Case Study\nLet's consider a mobile application for movie cinemas, which lists show times.\n\nLet's assess the data problem.\n\nCinemas change once a year.\nThe schedule changes every Thursday.\nThe static information rarely changes.\nWe need to support ticket reservations.\nWe don't need past data.\n\nLet's look at the data.

service immediately updates the client replica\nto what it optimistically expects the final result will be,\nand the user can see the change right away.\nThe replicator then emits an event.\nNext, the same processing occurs as for a remote service call:\nthe call to the server, the database processing, the filter, the service event on the client.\nFinally the replicator replaces the optimistic copy of the record\nwith the one provided by the server.\nThe replicator emits another event once this happens.\nBut what happens if the remote service rejects the mutation with an error?\nThe replicator has kept a copy of the record from before the mutation\nand, once it detects the error response,\nit replaces the optimistic copy of the record with the prior version.\nThe replicator emits a different event when this happen.\nIn a successful optimistic mutation, the replicator emits these\nevents:\n\n\n\naction\neventName\nrecord\nrecords\nsource\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nmutated\ncreated\nyes\nyes\n1\noptimistic update\n\n\nmutated\ncreated\nyes\nyes\n0\nremote service event\n\n\n\nWhen the remote service returns an error, the replicator emits:\n\n\n\naction\neventName\nrecord\nrecords\nsource\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nmutated\ncreated\nyes\nyes\n1\noptimistic update\n\n\nremove\nremoved\nyes\nyes\n2\nremote service error\n\n\n\nUsing data in the client replica\nThe optimistic mutator adapter has find and get methods\nwhich support the same feature set as feathers-memory.\nThis makes it a great way to retrieve data from the client replica.\nclientServices.find({ query: { username: 'john', $sort: { ... } } })\n  .then(data => ... );\n\nYou can also access the client replica\ndirectly.\nHooks\nThe remote service may run before and after hooks, and these may affect the data returned.\nThe optimistic value of the record in the client replica may end up being replaced with something\ndifferent.\n\nProTip: This may not make a difference in many use cases.\n\nIf this is problematic, hooks can be defined on the client for the optimistic-mutation service\nto reflect what the remote service does.\nIf this is still unsatisfactory,\nyou can always make direct remote service calls and live with the latency.\nuuid\nOptimistic mutation requires that the records contain a\nuuid\nproperty.\n()Its the only way the replicator can match an optimistic create to the created service event.)\n\nProTip: The id value for optimistic mutation service calls\nmust be the value of the uuid property in the data.\n\nThe optimistic mutation service's create method will automatically add a uuid property\nif it does not find one.\nYou can configure whether an industry standard 32-char uuid is used,\nor if a shorter uuid-like value is used.\n\nProTip: There is virtually\nno chance of collision\nwith the shorter value unless you work at high scale.\n\nYou can configure use of the 32-char uuid, instead of the default shorter value, with:\nconst messagesRealtime = new Realtime(messages, { ... });\nmessagesRealtime.useShortUuid(false);\n\n\nProTip: The replicator can provide you with uuid's for other purposes

Own-net\nWhat are the own-data and own-net strategies?\nThe core data for many mobile applications is unique to the user using the application.\nSince no one other than the user can change that user's data,\nthe client can safely mutate the remote data without concern that anyone is doing the same at that same time.\nWhile the client is disconnected, both strategies queue mutation events for later processing when reconnected.\nThe difference between them is what they queue.\nOwn-data queues every mutation event on the client service, and it will later process each mutation in order on the remote service.\nThe remote service can react to every mutation.\nIt may, for example, run hooks which send emails on certain mutations.\nOwn-net queues the net change for each record.\nIf a record is patched 5 times, own-net queues the record contents after the last of the changes.\nIf a record is created, patched and finally removed, the remote service will not see the mutations at all.\nOwn-net uses less storage on the client,\nand it reduces the load on the remote service upon reconnection.\n\nOnce the queue is processed, a snapshot refreshes the client's replica, bringing it up to date.\n\nOwn-data Case Study\nThe realtime case study involved displaying historical stock prices.\nLet's now allow the user to buy shares for his own portfolio.\n\nThe user will be disconnected if he takes a plane trip,\nand he will no longer receive stock price updates.\n\nHowever he can still make stock purchases.\nThey will be sent to the server when he reconnects after landing.\n\nSources:\n\n(**) MarinTodorov\n\n"},"guides/offline-first/syncdata-syncnet.html":{"url":"guides/offline-first/syncdata-syncnet.html","title":"Sync-data,

service.\nsync-data and sync-net are similar to own-data and own-net, however they detect mutation conflicts\nand help the server resolve them.\nEach queue entry contains the contents of the record before the mutation.\nSo each queue-entry for sync-data contains what the record contained on the client before each mutation.\nEach entry for sync-net contains what the record contained before the series of mutations.\nThe remote service, when processing the queued entries,\ncompares what the client service record contained before the mutation to what the remote service's record currently contains.\nIf the two are the same, then the client changed a record identical to what the remote currently has.\nThere is no conflict and the mutation may be performed on the remote.\nLet's say the user of one client device went on a plane trip and was offline for some time.\nDuring that time the user changed the addresses of several branch offices,\nin particular the NYC one from 100 Lexington to 123 Fifth Avenue.\nIn the meantime another user changed the address to 123 5-th Ave..\nThe queued mutations will be processed once the user reconnects after his flight.\nThe only conflict to occur will be for the NYC office.\nThe mutation from 100 Lexington to 123 Fifth Avenue conflicts with the record now being 123 5-th Ave. on the remote service.\n\nThe remote service's conflict resolver function will be called with:\n\nthe remote service's current record.\nthe client service's method call, e.g. 'create', 'update', ...\nthe client service's query object.\nthe client service's before record.\nthe record the client service wants to mutate to.\n\n\nThe resolver may indicate:\n\nthe current remote service's record is to be retained.\nthe remote service's record should be mutated to the client service's record.\nwhat the contents of the record should now be.\n\n\nThis allows the remote service great control over conflicts.\nHowever, in your particular use case, it may be appropriate to adapt a last-mutation-wins strategy\nand also use the client service's mutation.\nOther use cases may require analyzing the contents of the two records and applying business rules.\nSometimes own-data is sufficient\nLet's say a portion of your Neighborhood Watch app\nallows residents to report the location of a suspect in realtime,\nwhile the neighborhood waits for law enforcement to arrive.\nYour app may allow residents to update the suspect's location by using the mobile's geolocation.\n\nYou may decide, after assessing the application needs and legal requirements,\nto maintain only one record which contains only the suspect's latest location.\nAll the residents will be updating this one record.\nIn this use case, although many clients are updating the same record,\nyou might not care about detecting mutation conflicts among the various clients.\nThe app just cares about the latest sighting.\n\nYou have two choices.\n\nYou could use the sync-data strategy with the conflict resolver always choosing\nthe client services's latest record, or\nYou could use the own-data strategy and let the client mutations update over one another\nbased solely on when the clients do the mutation.\n\nWhenever you decide to always use the client mutation in the conflict resolver,\nconsider switching from the sync- strategy to a own- one,\nas in such cases the results are the same.\nKeep things simple\nYou don't always have to choose the most sophisticated strategy.\nIts harder to reason about designs which are more sophisticated.\nThere is a greater possibility of introducing errors.\nIt requires a software maintainer understand more things before working with the code.\nFinally, in this case, it increases the processing load on both the server and the client. \nOften the best course is to choose the simplest strategy which addresses the needs.\n"},"guides/offline-first/configure-snapshot.html":{"url":"guides/offline-first/configure-snapshot.html","title":"Configure snapshot","keywords":"","body":"Configure Snapshot\nInstallation\nnpm

realtime","keywords":"","body":"Configure Realtime, with optimistic mutation\nYou can keep on the client a near realtime replica of (some of) the records\nin a service configured on the server.\nYou can optimistically create, modify and remove records in the client replica\nusing standard Feathers service calls.\nThese mutations are also asynchronously performed on the server,\nand those delayed results may themselves mutate the client replica.\nAny errors on the server will revert the data in the client replica. \nThese features may make your client more performant, so it appears \"snappier.\"\nYou can replicate just a subset of the records in the service by providing\nan optional \"publication\" function\nwhich, given a record, determines if the record belongs in the publication.\nThe publication function may be as complicated as you need though it must be synchronous.\nYou or some other party may update a record so that it no longer belongs to the publication,\nor so that it newly belongs.\nThe replicator handles these situations.\nMany apps have unique data for every user.\nWith publications, you can keep the records for all users in one table,\nusing the publication feature to replicate to the client\nonly those records belonging to the client's user.\nA snapshot replication\nis used to initially obtain the records.\nThe realtime replicator can notify you of data mutations by emitting an event and/or\ncalling a subscription function for every notification.\nYou can in addition periodically poll the replicator to obtain the current realtime records.\n\nProTip: By default, the client will receive every service event.\nYou may however use feathers-offline-publication,\nas mentioned below for new Realtime(service,

fieldName2: -1 }) sorts on multiple fields\nin either ascending or descending order.\n\nYou can dynamically change the sort order as your needs change.\nThis can be useful for your UI.\nSnapshot performance\nBy default, the publication function will be run against every record in the service\nduring a snapshot.\nThis may lead to inefficiencies should, for example, a service contain records for 1,000 users\nand you want to replicate just the records for just one of them.\nTo avoid such situations, you may provide a\nFeathers query object,\nsuitable for use in a .find({ query }) call,\nto reduce the number of records read initially.\nThe publication function will still be run against the returned records.\n\nProTip: A publication function is required whenever you provide the query object,\nand the publication must be at least as restrictive as the query.\nProTip: You may find it convenient to use publication functions with\nthe same query object as their input.\nFor example

Publication\nPublications\npublications are objects containing multiple publication functions.\nThese functions determine if a record belongs in the publication or not.\nA sample publications is:\nconst publications = {\n  username: username => data => data.username === username,\n  active: () => data => !data.deleted,\n};\n\nThe publication publications.username('john') selects all records whose username is john;\npublications.active() selects all logically active records.\nYou can use the builtin query publication to selects records based on the\nquery syntax used by MongoDB.\nFor example:\nimport commonPublications from 'feathers-offline-publication/lib/common-publications';\ncommonPublications.query({ username: 'john' })\n`\n\nMinimize service events\nOnce a client associates a Feathers service with\n\na publications object, like the one above or commonPublications,\na publication function name, and\nparams for that function,\n\nthen that client will only be sent service events relevant to that publication.\nThis may improve performance, especially for mobile devices, as the bandwidth consumed by the client\nis reduced.\nThe server-side filtering for offline-first generally needs to look at\nboth the previous and the new contents of the record,\nto see if it used to belong or if it now belongs to the publication.\nYou can stash the current value of a record inside the hook object, before mutating it, with:\nmodule.exports = {\n  before: {\n    update: stashBefore(),\n    patch: stashBefore(),\n    remove: stashBefore(),\n  },\n};\n\nThe client will receive a service event if either the previous (stashed) value of the record,\nor the new value is within the publication.\nThis double check informs the client of records which previously belonged to the publication,\nbut no longer do so after the mutation.\nWhen records remain in the same publication\nIts not uncommon, for example, for mobile apps to have unique data per user.\nEach service model has a username field and, once that field is set on create, it never changes.\nThe client would use a publication such as the publications.username('john') from above\nto select only the records for its user.\nThere is no need in this case to check the previous (stashed) value of the record,\nand you can eliminate doing so by not running the stashBefore hook.\nThis would also marginally improve performance since stashBefore makes a get call.\nExample\nOn server:\nconst serverPublication = require('feathers-offline-publication/lib/server');\nconst commonPublications = require('feathers-offline-publication/lib/common-publications');\nconst app = feathers()...\n\nconst port = app.get('port');\nconst server = app.listen(port);\n\n// Configure service event filters for

that the same publications object must be provided both on the server and the client.\nAlso note the client may use the resultant function for any of its own filtering.\nSecurity\nAn attacker may modify the clientPublication.addPublication call on the client\nor issue one of their own.\nFeathers supports multiple service events filters for a method,\nand a mutation must satisfy them all before

publication\n\nLet's redo Example 2 using a \"publication\" rather than a filter function.\nWe expect the \"publication\" to minimize the number of service events sent to the client.\n\nRunning the example\nYou can run this example with:\ncd path/to/feathers-mobile/examples\nnpm install\ncd ./realtime-3\nnpm run build\nnpm start\n\nThen point a browser at localhost:3030\nand look at the log on

record into context.params\nbefore the record is mutated.\nThe service filter will use the stashed value to check if the record used to belong to the publication.\nThe serverPublication call configures the service filters,\nin this case for the stock service.\nYou can use syntax like ['messages', 'comments'] to configure multiple services at once.\n\nProTip: serverPublication must be run only after the server has started listening.\n\nThe key client code\nconst clientPublication = require('feathers-offline-publication/lib/client');\nconst commonPublications =

}),\n});\n\nstockRealtime.connect().then( ... );\n\nThe publication option is now a \"publication\" rather than a filter function.\nThe addPublication emits the name and params values to the server,\nwhile returning a filter function as the actual value for publication.\nThe server will start using name and params in the server-side service filters.\nLooking at the log\nThe previous

mutation\nThe realtime replicator's optimistic mutation may be used\nto produce a snappier response at the client.\n\nIts also an important step towards allowing the client to continue working while its offline.\n\nThe optimistic-mutator service immediately updates the client replica\nto what it optimistically expects the final result will be,\nand the user can see the change right away.\nThe replicator then emits a replication event because the client replica data has changed.\nNext, the same processing occurs as for a remote service call:\nthe call to the server, the database processing, the filter, the service event on the client.\nFinally the replicator replaces the optimistic copy of the record\nwith the one provided by the server.\nThen replicator emits another event because the client replica (may have) changed.\nBut what happens if the remote service rejects the mutation with an error?\nThe replicator has kept a copy of the record from before the mutation\nand, once it detects the error response,\nit replaces the optimistic copy of the record with the prior version.\nThe replicator emits a different event when this happen.\n\nLet's take the realtime example #1 and refactor it for optimistic mutation.\n\nRealtime example #1\nmutated data by calling methods on the remote service located on the server.\nThe client had to wait until the server finished the call and until it received the service event.\nOnly then could it mutate the client replica.\nLet's refactor the client so that it instead makes those same mutations by calling the\noptimistic-mutator at the

With it we can meet our goals, but (spoiler alert) it isn't an ideal solution.  We discuss some of its problems below.\nBasic upload with feathers-blob and feathers-client\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will be working over a very basic feathers server, with just the upload service. \nLets look at the server code:\n/* --- server.js --- */\n\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest');\nconst socketio = require('feathers-socketio');\nconst hooks = require('feathers-hooks');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst handler = require('feathers-errors/handler');\n\n\n// feathers-blob service\nconst blobService = require('feathers-blob');\n// Here we initialize a FileSystem storage,\n// but you can use feathers-blob with any other\n// storage service like AWS or Google Drive.\nconst fs = require('fs-blob-store');\nconst blobStorage = fs(__dirname + '/uploads');\n\n\n// Feathers app\nconst app = feathers();\n\n// Parse HTTP JSON bodies\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n// Parse URL-encoded params\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n// Register hooks module\napp.configure(hooks());\n// Add REST API support\napp.configure(rest());\n// Configure Socket.io real-time APIs\napp.configure(socketio());\n\n\n// Upload Service\napp.use('/uploads', blobService({Model: blobStorage}));\n\n\n// Register a nicer error handler than the default Express one\napp.use(handler());\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(3030, function(){\n    console.log('Feathers app started at localhost:3030')\n});\n\nfeathers-blob works over abstract-blob-store, which is an abstract interface to various storage backends, such as filesystem, AWS, or Google Drive. It only accepts and retrieves files encoded as dataURI strings.\nJust like that we have our backend ready, go ahead and POST something to localhost:3030/uploads`, for example with postman:\n{\n    \"uri\": \"data:image/gif;base64,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\"\n}\n\nThe service will respond with something like this:\n{\n  \"id\": \"6454364d8facd7a88e627e4c4b11b032d2f83af8f7f9329ffc2b7a5c879dc838.gif\",\n  \"uri\": \"the-same-uri-we-uploaded\",\n  \"size\": 1156\n}\n\nOr we can implement a very basic frontend with feathers-client and jQuery:\n\n\n    \n        Feathersjs File Upload\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            // feathers client initialization\n            const rest = feathers.rest('http://localhost:3030');\n            const app = feathers()\n            .configure(feathers.hooks())\n            .configure(rest.jquery($));\n\n            // setup jQuery to watch the ajax progress\n            $.ajaxSetup({\n                xhr: function () {\n                    var xhr = new window.XMLHttpRequest();\n                    // upload progress\n                    xhr.addEventListener(\"progress\", function (evt) {\n                        if (evt.lengthComputable) {\n                            var percentComplete = evt.loaded / evt.total;\n                            console.log('upload progress: ', Math.round(percentComplete * 100) + \"%\");\n                        }\n                    }, false);\n                    return xhr;\n                }\n            });\n\n            const uploadService = app.service('uploads');\n            const reader  = new FileReader();\n\n            // encode selected files\n            $(document).ready(function(){\n                $('input#file').change(function(){\n                    var file = this.files[0];\n                    // encode dataURI\n                    reader.readAsDataURL(file); \n                })\n            });\n\n            // when encoded, upload\n            reader.addEventListener(\"load\", function () {\n                console.log('encoded file: ', reader.result);\n                var upload = uploadService\n                    .create({uri: reader.result})\n                    .then(function(response){\n                        // success\n                        alert('UPLOADED!!

Everything works as expected.\nEvery file we select gets uploaded and saved to the ./uploads directory. \nWork done!, let's call it a day, shall we?\n... But hey, there is something that doesn't feels quite right ...right?\nDataURI upload problems\nIt doesn't feels right because it is not. Let's imagine what would happen if we try to upload a large file, say 25MB or more: The entire file (plus some extra MB due to the encoding) has to be kept in memory for the entire upload process, this could look like nothing for a normal computer but for mobile devices it's a big deal. \nWe have a big RAM consumption problem. Not to mention we have to encode the file before sending it... \nThe solution would be to modify the service, adding support for splitting the dataURI into small chunks, then uploading one at a time, collecting and reassembling everything on the server. But hey, it's not that the same thing   browsers and web servers has been doing since maybe the very early days of the web?  maybe since Netscape Navigator?\nWell, actually it is, and doing a multipart/form-data post is still the easiest way to upload a file.\nFeathers-blob with multipart support.\nBack with the backend, in order to accept multipart uploads, we need a way to handle the multipart/form-data received by the web server. Given that Feathers behaves like Express, let's just use multer and a custom middleware to handle that.\n/* --- server.js --- */\nconst multer = require('multer');\nconst multipartMiddleware = multer();\n\n// Upload Service with multipart support\napp.use('/uploads',\n\n    // multer parses the file named 'uri'.\n    // Without extra params the data is \n    // temporarely kept in memory\n    multipartMiddleware.single('uri'),\n\n    // another middleware, this time to \n    // transfer the received file to feathers \n    function(req,res,next){\n        req.feathers.file = req.file;\n        next();\n    },\n    blobService({Model: blobStorage})\n);\n\nNotice we kept the file field name as uri just to maintain uniformity, as the service will always work with that name anyways. But you can change it if you prefer.\nFeathers-blob only understands files encoded as dataURI, so we need to convert them first. Let's make a Hook for that:\n/* --- server.js --- */\nconst dauria = require('dauria');\n\n// before-create Hook to get the file (if there is any)\n// and turn it into a datauri,\n// transparently getting feathers-blob to work \n// with multipart file uploads\napp.service('/uploads').before({\n    create: [\n        function(hook) {\n            if (!hook.data.uri && hook.params.file){\n                const file = hook.params.file;\n                const uri = dauria.getBase64DataURI(file.buffer, file.mimetype);\n                hook.data = {uri: uri};\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n});\n\nEt voil√†!. Now we have a FeathersJS file storage service working, with support for traditional multipart uploads, and a variety of storage options to choose. \nSimply awesome.\nFurther improvements\nThe service always return the dataURI back to us, which may not be necessary as we'd just uploaded the file, also we need to validate the file and check for authorization. \nAll those things can be easily done with more Hooks, and that's the benefit of keeping all inside FeathersJS services. I left that to you.\nFor the frontend, there is a problem with the client: in order to show the upload progress it's stuck with only REST functionality and not real-time with socket.io. \nThe solution is to switch feathers-client from REST to socket.io, and just use wherever you like for uploading the files, that's an easy task now that we are able to do a traditional form-multipart upload.\nHere is an example using dropzone:\n\n\n    \n        Feathersjs File Upload\n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n            // feathers client initialization\n            var socket = io('http://localhost:3030');\n            const app = feathers()\n            .configure(feathers.hooks())\n            .configure(feathers.socketio(socket));\n            const uploadService = app.service('uploads');\n\n            // Now with Real-Time Support!\n            uploadService.on('created', function(file){\n                alert('Received file created event!', file);\n            });\n\n\n            // Let's use DropZone!\n            Dropzone.options.myAwesomeDropzone = {\n                paramName: \"uri\",\n                uploadMultiple: false,\n                init: function(){\n                    this.on('uploadprogress', function(file, progress){\n                        console.log('progresss', progress);\n                    });\n                }\n            };\n        \n    \n    \n        Let's upload some files!\n        \n    \n\n\nAll the code is available via github here: https://github.com/CianCoders/feathers-example-fileupload\nHope you have learned something today, as I learned a lot writing this. \nCheers!\n"},"guides/advanced/creating-a-plugin.html":{"url":"guides/advanced/creating-a-plugin.html","title":"Creating a Feathers plugin","keywords":"","body":"Creating a Feathers Plugin\nThe easiest way to create a plugin is with the Yeoman generator.\nFirst install the generator\n$ npm install -g generator-feathers-plugin\n\nThen in a new directory run: \n$ yo feathers-plugin\n\nThis will scaffold out everything that is needed to start writing your plugin. \nOutput files from generator: \n   create package.json\n   create .babelrc\n   create .editorconfig\n   create .jshintrc\n   create .travis.yml\n   create src/index.js\n   create test/index.test.js\n   create README.md\n   create LICENSE\n   create .gitignore\n   create .npmignore\nSimple right? We technically could call it a day as we have created a Plugin. However, we probably want to do just a bit more. Generally speaking a Plugin is a Service. The fun part is that a Plugin can contain multiple Services which we will create below. This example is going to build out 2 services. The first will allow us to find members of the Feathers Core Team & the second will allow us to find the best state in the United States. \nVerifying our Service\nBefore we start writing more code we need to see that things are working. \n$ cd example && node app.js\n\nError: Cannot find module '../lib/index'\nDang! Running the example app resulted in an error and you said to yourself, \"The generator must be broken and we should head over to the friendly Slack community to start our debugging journey\". Well, as nice as they may be we can get through this. Let's take a look at the package.json that came with our generator. Most notably the scripts section. \n\"scripts\": {\n    \"prepublish\": \"npm run compile\",\n    \"publish\": \"git push origin && git push origin --tags\",\n    \"release:patch\": \"npm version patch && npm publish\",\n    \"release:minor\": \"npm version minor && npm publish\",\n    \"release:major\": \"npm version major && npm publish\",\n    \"compile\": \"rimraf lib/ && babel -d lib/ src/\",\n    \"watch\": \"babel --watch -d lib/ src/\",\n    \"jshint\": \"jshint src/. test/. --config\",\n    \"mocha\": \"mocha --recursive test/ --compilers js:babel-core/register\",\n    \"test\": \"npm run compile && npm run jshint && npm run mocha\",\n    \"start\": \"npm run compile && node example/app\"\n  }\n\nBack in business. That error message was telling us that we need to build our project. In this case it means babel needs to do it's thing. \nFor development you can run watch\n$ npm run watch\n\n> creatingPlugin@0.0.0 watch /Users/ajones/git/training/creatingPlugin\n> babel --watch -d lib/ src/\n\nsrc/index.js -> lib/index.js\nAfter that you can run the example app and everything should be good to go. \n$ node app.js\nFeathers app started on 127.0.0.1:3030\nExpanding our Plugin\nNow that we did our verification we can safely change things. For this example we want 2 services to be exposed from our Plugin.

There are a few different ways that you can structure your app so this guide will show you 3 typical ways you might have your Feathers app organized.\nA Single \"Monolithic\" App\nYou probably already know that when you register a Feathers service, Feathers creates RESTful endpoints for that service automatically. Well, really those are just Express routes, so you can define your own as well.\n\nProTip: Your own defined REST endpoints won't work with hooks and won't emit socket events. If you find you need that functionality it's probably better for you to turn your endpoints into a minimal Feathers service.\n\nLet's say you want to render a list of messages from most recent to oldest using the Jade template engine.\n// You've set up your main Feathers app already\n\n// Register your view engine\napp.set('view engine', 'jade');\n\n// Register your message service\napp.use('/api/messages', memory());\n\n// Inside your main Feathers app\napp.get('/messages', function(req, res, next){\n  // You namespace your feathers service routes so that\n  // don't get route conflicts and have nice URLs.\n  app.service('api/messages')\n    .find({ query: {$sort: { updatedAt: -1 } } })\n    .then(result => res.render('message-list', result.data))\n    .catch(next);\n});\n\nSimple right? We've now rendered a list of messages. All your hooks will get triggered just like they would normally so you can use hooks to pre-filter your data and keep your template rendering routes super tight.\n\nProTip: If you call a Feathers service \"internally\" (ie. not over sockets or REST) you won't have a hook.params.provider attribute. This allows you to have hooks only execute when services are called externally vs. from your own code. See bundled hooks for an example.\n\nFeathers As A Sub-App\nSometimes a better way to break up your Feathers app is to put your services into an API and mount your API as a sub-app. This is just like you would do with Express. If you do this, it's only a slight change to get data from your services.\n// You've set up your main Feathers app already\n\n// Register your view engine\napp.set('view engine', 'jade');\n\n// Require your configured API sub-app\nconst api = require('./api');\n\n// Register your API sub app\napp.use('/api', api);\n‚Äã\napp.get('/messages', function(req, res, next){\n  api.service('messages')\n    .find({ query: {$sort: { updatedAt: -1 } } })\n    .then(result => res.render('message-list', result.data))\n    .catch(next);\n});\n\nNot a whole lot different. Your API sub app is pretty much the same as your single app in the previous example, and your main Feathers app is just a really small wrapper that does little more than render templates.\nFeathers As A Separate App\nIf your app starts to get a bit busier you might decide to move your API to a completely separate standalone Feathers app, maybe even on a different server. In order for both apps to talk to each other they'll need some way to make remote requests. Well, Feathers just so happens to have a client side piece that can be used on the server. This is how it works.\n// You've set up your feathers app already\n\n// Register your view engine\napp.set('view engine', 'jade');\n\n// Include the Feathers client modules\nconst client = require('feathers/client');\nconst socketio = require('feathers-socketio/client');\nconst io = require('socket.io-client');\n‚Äã\n// Set up a socket connection to our remote API\nconst socket = io('http://api.feathersjs.com');\nconst api = client().configure(socketio(socket));\n‚Äã\napp.get('/messages', function(req, res, next){\n  api.service('messages')\n    .find({ query: {$sort: { updatedAt: -1 } } })\n    .then(result => res.render('message-list', result.data))\n    .catch(next);\n});\n\n\nProTip: In the above example we set up sockets. Alternatively you could use a Feathers client REST provider.\n\nAnd with that, we've shown 3 different ways that you use a template engine with Feathers to render service data.

Feathers is designed to scale.\nThe types of transports used in a feathers application will impact the scaling configuration. For example, a feathers app that uses the feathers-rest adapter exclusively will require less scaling configuration because HTTP is a stateless protocol. If using websockets (a stateful protocol) through the feathers-socketio or feathers-primus adapters, configuration may be more complex to ensure websockets work properly.\nHorizontal Scaling\nScaling horizontally refers to either:\n\nsetting up a cluster, or\nadding more machines to support your application\n\nTo achieve high availability, varying combinations of both strategies may be used.\nCluster configuration\nCluster support is built into core NodeJS. Since NodeJS is single threaded, clustering allows you to easily distribute application requests among multiple child processes (and multiple threads). Clustering is a good choice when running feathers in a multi-core environment.\nBelow is an example of adding clustering to feathers with the feathers-socketio provider. By default, websocket connections begin via a handshake of multiple HTTP requests and are upgraded to the websocket protocol. However, when clustering is enabled, the same worker will not process all HTTP requests for a handshake, leading to HTTP 400 errors. To ensure a successful handshake, force a single worker to process the handshake by disabling the http transport and exclusively using the websocket transport.\nThere are notable side effects to be aware of when disabling the HTTP transport for websockets. While all modern browsers support websocket connections, there is no websocket support for IE . If you must support these browsers, use alternative scaling strategies.\nimport cluster from 'cluster';\nimport feathers from 'feathers';\nimport socketio from 'feathers-socketio';\n\nconst CLUSTER_COUNT = 4;\n\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n  for (let i = 0; i \nIn your feathers client code, limit the socket.io-client to the websocket transport and disable upgrade.\nimport hooks from 'feathers-hooks';\nimport feathers from 'feathers/client';\nimport io from 'socket.io-client';\nimport socketio from 'feathers-socketio/client';\n\nconst app = feathers()\n  .configure(hooks())\n  .configure(socketio(\n    io('http://api.feathersjs.com', {\n      transports: ['websocket'],\n      upgrade: false\n    })\n  ));\n\n"},"api/readme.html":{"url":"api/readme.html","title":"API","keywords":"","body":"API\n\nCore\nApplication\nServices\nHooks\nCommon Hooks\nClient\nEvents\nErrors\n\n\nTransports\nREST\nExpress\nSocket.io\nPrimus\n\n\nAuthentication\nServer\nClient\nLocal\nJWT\nOAuth1\nOAuth2\nHooks\n\n\nDatabases\nCommon API\nQuerying\nMemory\nNeDb\nLocalStorage\nMongoDB\nMongoose\nSequelize\nKnex\nRethinkDB\n\n\n\n"},"api/application.html":{"url":"api/application.html","title":"Application","keywords":"","body":"Application\n\n\n\n$ npm install feathers --save\nThe core feathers module provides the ability to initialize new Feathers application instances.

Feathers itself will also add some additional methods and functionality to its services.\nService methods\nService methods are pre-defined CRUD methods that your service object can implement (or that has already been implemented by one of the database adapters). Below is a complete example of the Feathers service interface:\nconst myService = {\n  find(params) {},\n  get(id, params) {},\n  create(data, params) {},\n  update(id, data, params) {},\n  patch(id, data, params) {},\n  remove(id, params) {},\n  setup(app, path) {}\n}\n\napp.use('/my-service', myService);\n\nOr as an ES6 class:\n'use strict';\n\nclass MyService {\n  find(params) {}\n  get(id, params) {}\n  create(data, params) {}\n  update(id, data, params) {}\n  patch(id, data, params) {}\n  remove(id, params) {}\n  setup(app, path) {}\n}\n\napp.use('/my-service', new MyService());\n\n\nProTip: Methods are optional, and if a method is not implemented Feathers will automatically emit a NotImplemented error.\n\nService methods have to return a Promise and have the following parameters:\n\nid - the identifier for the resource. A resource is the data identified by a unique id.\ndata - the resource data.\nparams - can contain any extra parameters, for example the authenticated user.\n\n\nImportant: params.query contains the query parameters from the client, either passed as URL query paramters (see the REST chapter) or through websockets (see Socket.io or Primus).\n\nOnce registered the service can be retrieved and used via app.service():\nconst myService = app.service('my-service');\n\nmyService.find().then(items => console.log('.find()', items));\nmyService.get(1).then(item => console.log('.get(1)', items));\n\nKeep in mind that services don't have to use databases.

They are already implemented by Feathers official database adapters. For specifics on how to use the database adapters see the database adapters common API.\n\n.find(params)\nfind(params) -> Promise - retrieves a list of all resources from the service.

The method should return a Promise with the complete updated resource data. id can also be null when updating multiple records with params.query containing the query criteria.\n\nImportant: A successful update method call emits the updated service event.\n\n.patch(id, data, params)\npatch(id, data, params) -> Promise - merges the existing data of the resource identified by id with the new data. id can also be null indicating that multiple resources should be patched with params.query containing the query criteria.\nThe method should return with the complete updated resource data. Implement patch additionally (or instead of) update if you want to separate between partial and full updates and support the PATCH HTTP method.\n\nImportant: A successful patch method call emits the patched service event.\n\n.remove(id, params)\nremove(id, params) -> Promise - removes the resource with id. The method should return a Promise with the removed resource. id can also be null indicating to delete multiple resources with params.query containing the query criteria.\n\nImportant: A successful remove method call emits the removed service event.\n\n.setup(app, path)\nsetup(app, path) -> Promise is a special method that initializes the service, passing an instance of the Feathers application and the path it has been registered on. \nFor services registered before app.listen is invoked, the setup function of each registered service is called upon invoking app.listen.

Hook objects have read only properties that should not be modified and writeable properties that can be changed for subsequent hooks.\n\nRead Only:\napp - The app object (used to e.g. retrieve other services)\nservice - The service this hook currently runs on\npath - The path (name) of the service\nmethod - The service method name\ntype - The hook type (before, after or error)\n\n\nWriteable:\nparams - The service method parameters (including params.query)\nid - The id (for get, remove, update and patch)\ndata - The request data (for create, update and patch)\nerror - The error that was thrown (only in error hooks)\nresult - The result of the successful method call (only in after hooks).\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip: hook.result Can also be set in a before hook which will skip the service method call (but run all other hooks).\n\n\n\nPro Tip: hook.id can also be null for update, patch and remove. See the service methods for more information.\n\n\n\nPro Tip: The hook object is the same throughout a service method call so it is possible to add properties and use them in other hooks at a later time.\n\nHook functions\nA hook function (or just hook) takes a hook object as the parameter (function(hook) {} or hook => {}) and can\n\nreturn nothing (undefined)\nreturn the hook object\nthrow an error\nfor asynchronous operations return a Promise that\nresolves with a hook object\nresolves with undefined\nrejects with an error\n\n\n\nWhen an error is thrown (or the promise is rejected), all subsequent hooks - and the service method call if it didn't run already - will be skipped and only the error hooks will run.\nThe following example throws an error when the text for creating a new message is empty. You can also create very similar hooks to use your Node validation library of choice.\napp.service('messages').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      function(hook) {\n        if(hook.data.text.trim() === '') {\n          throw new Error('Message text can not be empty');\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nAsynchronous hooks\nWhen a Promise is returned the hook will wait until it resolves or rejects before continuing.\n\nImportant: As stated in the hook functions section the promise has to either resolve with the hook object (usually done with .then(() => hook) at the end of the promise chain) or with undefined.\n\nThe following example shows an asynchronous hook that uses another service to retrieve and populate the messages user when getting a single message.\napp.service('messages').hooks({\n  after: {\n    get: [\n      function(hook) {\n        const userId = hook.result.userId;\n\n        // hook.app.service('users').get returns a Promise already\n        return hook.app.service('users').get(userId).then(user => {\n          // Update the result (the message)\n          hook.result.user = user;\n\n          // Returning will resolve the promise with the `hook` object\n          return hook;\n        });\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nWhen the asynchronous operation is using a callback instead of returning a promise you have to create and return a new Promise (new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})).\nThe following example reads a JSON file with fs.readFile and adds it to the message:\napp.service('messages').hooks({\n  after: {\n    get: [\n      function(hook) {\n        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n          require('fs').readFile('./myfile.json', (error, data) => {\n            // Check if the callback got an error, if so reject the promise and return\n            if(error) {\n              return reject(error);\n            }\n\n            hook.result.myFile = JSON.parse(data.toString());\n\n            // Resolve the promise with the `hook` object\n            resolve(hook);\n          });\n        });\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\n\nPro Tip: Tools like Bluebird make converting between callbacks and promises easier.\n\n\n\nImportant: Most Feathers service calls and newer Node packages already return Promises. They can be returned and chained directly. There is no need to instantiate your own new Promise instance in those cases.\n\nRegistering hooks\nHook functions are registered on a service through the app.service().hooks(hooks) method. There are several options for what can be passed as hooks:\n// The standard all at once way (also used by the generator)\n// an array of functions per service method name (and for `all` methods)\napp.service('servicename').hooks({\n  before: {\n    all: [\n      // Use normal functions\n      function(hook) { console.log('before all hook ran'); }\n    ],\n    find: [\n      // Use ES6 arrow functions\n      hook => console.log('before find hook 1 ran'),\n      hook => console.log('before find hook 2 ran')\n    ],\n    get: [ /* other hook functions here */ ],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  },\n  after: {\n    all: [],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  },\n  error: {\n    all: [],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [],\n    update: [],\n    patch: [],\n    remove: []\n  }\n});\n\n// Register a single hook before, after and on error for all methods\napp.service('servicename').hooks({\n  before(hook) {\n    console.log('before all hook ran');\n  },\n  after(hook) {\n    console.log('after all hook ran');\n  },\n  error(hook) {\n    console.log('error all hook ran');\n  }\n});\n\n\nPro Tip: When using the full object, all is a special keyword meaning this hook will run for all methods. all hooks will be registered before other method specific hooks.\nPro Tip: app.service().hooks(hooks) can be called multiple times and the hooks will be registered in that order. Normally all hooks should be registered at once however to see at a glance what what the service is going to do.\n\nApplication hooks\nTo add hooks to every service app.hooks(hooks) can be used. Application hooks are registered in the same format as service hooks and also work exactly the same. Note when application hooks will be executed however:\n\nbefore application hooks will always run before all service before hooks\nafter application hooks will always run after all service after hooks\nerror application hooks will always run after all service error hooks\n\nHere is an example for a very useful application hook that logs every service method error with the service and method name as well as the error stack.\napp.hooks({\n  error(hook) {\n    console.error(`Error in '${hook.path}' service method '${hook.method}`, hook.error.stack);\n  }\n});\n\n"},"api/hooks-common.html":{"url":"api/hooks-common.html","title":"Common Hooks","keywords":"","body":"Common Hooks\n\n\n\n$ npm install feathers-hooks-common --save\nfeathers-hooks-common is a collection of common hooks and utilities.\nAuthentication hooks are documented separately.\n\nNote: Many hooks are just a few lines of code to implement from scratch.

Details are below.\nFunction signature (hook: Hook, options: Object): Object\nhook The hook.\noptions The options passed to the populate hook.\n\n\ncheckPermissions [optional, default () => true] Function to check if the user is allowed to perform this populate,\nor include this type of item. Called whenever a permissions property is found.\nFunction signature (hook: Hook, service: string, permissions: any, depth: number): boolean\nhook The hook.\nservice The name of the service being included, e.g. users, messages.\npermissions The value of the permissions property.\ndepth How deep the include is in the schema. Top of schema is 0.\nReturn truesy to allow the include.\n\n\nprofile [optional, default false] If true, the populated result is to contain a performance profile.\nMust be true, truesy is insufficient.\n\nSchema\nThe data currently in the hook will be populated according to the schema. The schema starts with:\nconst schema = {\n  service: '...',\n  permissions: '...',\n  include: [ ... ]\n};\n\n\nservice (optional) The name of the service this schema is to be used with.\nThis can be used to prevent a schema designed to populate 'blog' items\nfrom being incorrectly used with comment items.\npermissions (optional, any type of value) Who is allowed to perform this populate. See checkPermissions above.\ninclude (optional) Which services to join to the data.\n\nInclude\nThe include array has an element for each service to join. They each may have:\n{ service: 'comments',\n  nameAs: 'commentItems',\n  permissions: '...',\n  parentField: 'id',\n  childField: 'postId',\n  query: {\n    $limit: 5,\n    $select: ['title', 'content', 'postId'],\n    $sort: {createdAt: -1}\n  },\n  select: (hook, parent, depth) => ({ $limit: 6 }),\n  asArray: true,\n  paginate: false,\n  provider: undefined,\n  useInnerPopulate: false,\n  include: [ ... ]\n}\n\n\nProTip Instead of setting include to a 1-element array,\nyou can set it to the include object itself,\ne.g. include: { service: ..., nameAs: ..., ... }.\n\n\nservice [required, string] The name of the service providing the items.\nnameAs [optional, string, default is service] Where to place the items from the join.\nDot notation is allowed.\npermissions [optional, any type of value] Who is allowed to perform this join. See checkPermissions above.\nparentField [required if neither query nor select, string] The name of the field in the parent item for the relation.\nDot notation is allowed.\nchildField [required if neither query nor select, string] The name of the field in the child item for the relation.\nDot notation is allowed and will result in a query like { 'name.first': 'John' }\nwhich is not suitable for all DBs.\nYou may use query or select to create a query suitable for your DB.\nquery [optional, object] An object to inject into the query in service.find({ query: { ... } }).\nselect [optional, function] A function whose result is injected into the query.\nFunction signature (hook: Hook, parentItem: Object, depth: number): Object\nhook The hook.\nparentItem The parent item to which we are joining.\ndepth How deep the include is in the schema. Top of schema is 0.\n\n\nasArray [optional, boolean, default false] Force a single joined item to be stored as an array.\npaginate {optional, boolean or number, default false]\nControls pagination for this service.\nfalse No pagination. The default.\ntrue Use the configuration provided when the service was configured/\nA number. The maximum number of items to include.\n\n\nprovider [optional] find calls are made to obtain the items to be joined.\nThese, by default, are initialized to look like they were made\nby the same provider as that getting the base record.\nSo when populating the result of a call made via socketio,\nall the join calls will look like they were made via socketio.\nAlternative you can set provider: undefined and the calls for that join will\nlook like they were made by the server.\nThe hooks on the service may behave differently in different situations.\nuseInnerPopulate [optional] Populate, when including records from a child service,\nignores any populate hooks defined for that child service.\nThe useInnerPopulate option will run those populate hooks.\nThis allows the populate for a base record to include child records\ncontaining their own immediate child records,\nwithout the populate for the base record knowing what those grandchildren populates are.\ninclude [optional] The new items may themselves include other items. The includes are recursive.\n\nPopulate forms the query [childField]: parentItem[parentField] when the parent value is not an array.\nThis will include all child items having that value.\nPopulate forms the query [childField]: { $in: parentItem[parentField] } when the parent value is an array.\nThis will include all child items having any of those values.\nA populate hook for, say, posts may include items from users.\nShould the users hooks also include a populate,\nthat users populate hook will not be run for includes arising from posts.\n\nProTip The populate interface only allows you to directly manipulate hook.params.query.\nYou can manipulate the rest of hook.params by using the\nclient hook,\nalong with something like query: { ..., $client: { paramsProp1: ..., paramsProp2: ... } }.\n\nAdded properties\nSome additional properties are added to populated items. The result may look like:\n{ ...\n  _include: [ 'post' ],\n  _elapsed: { post: 487947, total: 527118 },\n  post:\n    { ...\n      _include: [ 'authorItem', 'commentsInfo', 'readersInfo' ],\n      _elapsed: { authorItem: 321973, commentsInfo: 469375, readersInfo: 479874, total: 487947 },\n      _computed: [ 'averageStars', 'views' ],\n      authorItem: { ... },\n      commentsInfo: [ { ... }, { ... } ],\n      readersInfo: [ { ... }, { ... } ]\n} }\n\n\n_include The property names containing joined items.\n_elapsed The elapsed time in nano-seconds (where 1,000,000 ns === 1 ms) taken to perform each include,\nas well as the total taken for them all.\nThis delay is mostly attributed to your DB.\n_computed The property names containing values computed by the serialize hook.\n\nThe depopulate hook uses these fields to remove all joined and computed values.\nThis allows you to then service.patch() the item in the hook.\nJoining without using related fields\nPopulate can join child records to a parent record using the related columns\nparentField and childField.\nHowever populate's query and select options may be used to related the\nrecords without needing to use the related columns.\nThis is a more flexible, non-SQL-like way of relating records.\nIt easily supports dynamic, run-time schemas since the select option may be\na function.\nPopulate examples\nSelecting schema based on UI needs\nConsider a Purchase Order item.\nAn Accounting oriented UI will likely want to populate the PO with Invoice items.\nA Receiving oriented UI will likely want to populate with Receiving Slips.\nUsing a function for schema allows you to select an appropriate schema based on the need.\nThe following example shows how the client can ask for the type of schema it needs.\n// on client\nimport { paramsForServer } from 'feathers-hooks-common';\npurchaseOrders.get(id, paramsForServer({ schema: 'po-acct' })); // pass schema name to server\n// or\npurchaseOrders.get(id, paramsForServer({ schema: 'po-rec' }));\n\n// on server\nimport { paramsFromClient } from 'feathers-hooks-common';\nconst poSchemas = {\n  'po-acct': /* populate schema for Accounting oriented PO e.g. { include: ... } */,\n  'po-rec': /* populate schema for Receiving oriented PO */\n};\n\npurchaseOrders.before({\n  all: paramsfromClient('schema')\n});\n\npurchaseOrders.after({\n  all: populate({ schema: hook => poSchemas[hook.params.schema] }),\n});\n\nUsing permissions\nFor a simplistic example,\nassume hook.params.users.permissions is an array of the service names the user may use,\ne.g. ['invoices', 'billings'].\nThese can be used to control which types of items the user can see.\nThe following populate will only be performed for users whose user.permissions contains 'invoices'.\nconst schema = {\n  include: [\n    {\n      service: 'invoices',\n      permissions: 'invoices',\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\npurchaseOrders.after({\n  all: populate(schema, (hook, service, permissions) => hook.params.user.permissions.includes(service))\n});\n\nSee also dePopulate, serialize.\npreventChanges\npreventChanges(... fieldNames) source\nPrevents the specified fields from being patched.\n\nUsed as a before hook for patch.\nField names support dot notation e.g. name.address.city.\n\nconst { preventChanges } = require('feathers-hooks-common');\n\napp.service('users').before({\n  patch: preventChanges('security.badge')\n})\n\nOptions:\n\nfieldNames (required) - One or more fields which may not be patched.\n\n\nConsider using verifySchema if you would rather specify which fields are allowed to change.\n\nremove\nremove(... fieldNames) source\nRemove the given fields either from the data submitted or from the result. If the data is an array or a paginated find result the hook will remove the field(s) for every item.\n\nUsed as a before hook for create, update or patch.\nUsed as an after hook.\nField names support dot notation e.g. name.address.city.\nSupports multiple data items, including paginated find.\n\nconst { remove } = require('feathers-hooks-common');\n\n// Remove the hashed `password` and `salt` field after all method calls\napp.service('users').after(remove('password', 'salt'));\n\n// Remove _id for `create`, `update` and `patch`\napp.service('users').before({\n  create: remove('_id', 'password'),\n  update: remove('_id'),\n  patch: remove('_id')\n})\n\n\nProTip: This hook will only fire when params.provider has a value, i.e. when it is an external request over REST or Sockets.\n\nOptions:\n\nfieldNames (required) - One or more fields you want to remove from the object(s).\n\nSee also discard.\nremoveQuery\nremoveQuery(... fieldNames) source\nRemove the given fields from the query params.\n\nUsed as a before hook.\nField names support dot notation\nSupports multiple data items, including paginated find.\n\nconst { removeQuery } = require('feathers-hooks-common');\n\n// Remove _id from the query for all service methods\napp.service('users').before({\n  all: removeQuery('_id')\n});\n\n\nProTip: This hook will only fire when params.provider has a value, i.e. when it is an external request over REST or Sockets.\n\nOptions:\n\nfieldNames (optional) - The fields that you want to remove from the query object.\n\nserialize\nserialize(schema: Object|Function): HookFunc source\nRemove selected information from populated items. Add new computed information.\nIntended for use with the populate hook.\nconst schema = {\n  only: 'updatedAt',\n  computed: {\n    commentsCount: (recommendation, hook) => recommendation.post.commentsInfo.length,\n  },\n  post: {\n    exclude: ['id', 'createdAt', 'author', 'readers'],\n    authorItem: {\n      exclude: ['id', 'password', 'age'],\n      computed: {\n        isUnder18: (authorItem, hook) => authorItem.age \nOptions\n\nschema [required, object or function] How to serialize the items.\nFunction signature (hook: Hook): Object\nhook The hook.\n\n\n\nThe schema reflects the structure of the populated items.\nThe base items for the example above have included post items,\nwhich themselves have included authorItem, readersInfo and commentsInfo items.\nThe schema for each set of items may have\n\nonly [optional, string or array of strings] The names of the fields to keep in each item.\nThe names for included sets of items plus _include and _elapsed are not removed by only.\nexclude [optional, string or array of strings] The names of fields to drop in each item.\nYou may drop, at your own risk, names of included sets of items, _include and _elapsed.\ncomputed [optional, object with functions] The new names you want added and how to compute their values.\nObject is like { name: func, ...}\nname The name of the field to add to the items.\nfunc Function with signature (item, hook).\nitem The item with all its initial values, plus all of its included items.\nThe function can still reference values which will be later removed by only and exclude.\nhook The hook passed to serialize.\n\n\n\n\n\nSerialize examples\nA simple serialize\nThe populate example above produced the result\n{ id: 9, title: 'The unbearable ligthness of FeathersJS', author: 5, yearBorn: 1990,\n  authorItem: { id: 5, email: 'john.doe@gmail.com', name: 'John Doe' },\n  _include: ['authorItem']\n}\n\nWe could tailor the result more to what we need with:\nconst serializeSchema = {\n  only: ['title'],\n  authorItem: {\n    only: ['name']\n    computed: {\n      isOver18: (authorItem, hook) => new Date().getFullYear() - authorItem.yearBorn >= 18,\n    },\n  }\n};\napp.service('posts').before({\n  get: [ hooks.populate({ schema }), serialize(serializeSchema) ],\n  find: [ hooks.populate({ schema }), serialize(serializeSchema) ]\n});\n\nThe result would now be\n{ title: 'The unbearable ligthness of FeathersJS',\n  authorItem: { name: 'John Doe', isOver18: true, _computed: ['isOver18'] },\n  _include: ['authorItem'],\n}\n\nUsing permissions\nConsider an Employee item.\nThe Payroll Manager would be permitted to see the salaries of other department heads.\nNo other person would be allowed to see them.\nUsing a function for schema allows you to select an appropriate schema based on the need.\nAssume hook.params.user.roles contains an array of roles which the user performs.\nThe Employee item can be serialized differently for the Payroll Manager than for anyone else.\nconst payrollSerialize = {\n  'payrollMgr': { /* serialization schema for Payroll Manager */},\n  'payroll': { /* serialization schema for others */}\n};\n\nemployees.after({\n  all: [\n    populate( ... ),\n    serialize(hook => payrollSerialize[\n      hook.params.user.roles.contains('payrollMgr') ?

Checking the item object contains the expected properties with values in the expected format. The values might get sanitized. Knowing the item is well formed makes further validation simpler.\nRe-running any validation supposedly already done on the front-end. It would an asset if the server can re-run the same code the front-end used.\nPerforming any validation and sanitization unique to the server.\n\nA full featured example of such a process appears below. It validates and sanitizes a new user before adding the user to the database.\n\nThe form expects to be notified of errors in the format { email: 'Invalid email.', password: 'Password must be at least 8 characters.' }.\nThe form calls the server for async checking of selected fields when control leaves those fields. This for example could check that an email address is not already used by another user.\nThe form does local sync validation when the form is submitted.\nThe code performing the validations on the front-end is also used by the server.\nThe server performs schema validation using Walmart's Joi.\nThe server does further validation and sanitization.\n\nValidation using Validate\n// file /server/services/users/hooks/index.js\nconst auth = require('feathers-authentication').hooks;\nconst { callbackToPromise, remove, validate } = require('feathers-hooks-common');\nconst validateSchema = require('feathers-hooks-validate-joi');\n\nconst clientValidations = require('/common/usersClientValidations');\nconst serverValidations = require('/server/validations/usersServerValidations');\nconst schemas = require('/server/validations/schemas');\n\nconst serverValidationsSignup = callbackToPromise(serverValidations.signup, 1);\n\nexports.before = {\n  create: [\n    validateSchema.form(schemas.signup, schemas.options), // schema validation\n    validate(clientValidations.signup), // re-run form sync validation\n    validate(values => clientValidations.signupAsync(values, 'someMoreParams')), // re-run form async\n    validate(serverValidationsSignup), // run server validation\n    remove('confirmPassword'),\n    auth.hashPassword()\n  ]\n};\n\nValidation routines for front and back-end.\nValidations used on front-end.

It is extremely lightweight, however, with Express having been replaced by a thin wrapper.  There are differences between the client and server APIs.  Learn more under each method on the Application API page.\nNode and npm loaders\nThe client utilities can be used directly on the server.  Just require each individual package or the feathers-client and use it the same way as shown for in the browser examples, below.  Node.js natively supports the CommonJS module syntax.

All events in Feathers are provided through the NodeJS EventEmitter interface. This section describes\n\nA quick overview of the NodeJS EventEmitter interface\nThe standard service events\nHow to filter events so that only allowed clients receive them\nHow to allow sending custom events from the server to the client\n\n\nVery important: Event filters are critical for properly securing a Feathers real-time application.\n\nEventEmitters\nOnce registered, any service gets turned into a standard NodeJS EventEmitter and can be used accordingly.\nconst messages = app.service('messages');\n\n// Listen to a normal service event\nmessages.on('patched', message => console.log('message patched', message));\n\n// Only listen to an event once\nmesssages.once('removed', message =>\n  console.log('First time a message has been removed', message)\n);\n\n// A reference to a handler\nconst onCreatedListener = message => console.log('New message created', message);\n\n// Listen `created` with a handler reference\nmessages.on('created', onCreatedListener);\n\n// Unbind the `created` event listener\nmessages.removeListener('created', onCreatedListener);\n\n// Send a custom event\nmessages.emit('customEvent', {\n  type: 'customEvent',\n  data: 'can be anything'\n});\n\nService Events\nAny service automaticaly emits created, updated, patched and removed events when the respective service method returns successfully. This works on the client as well as on the server. When the client is using Socket.io or Primus, events will be pushed automatically from the server to all connected client. This is essentially how Feathers does real-time.\n\nProTip: Events are not fired until all of your hooks have executed.\n\ncreated\nThe created event will fire with the result data when a service create returns successfully.\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst app = feathers();\n\napp.use('/messages', {\n  create(data, params) {\n    return Promise.resolve(data);\n  }\n});\n\n// Retrieve the wrapped service object which will be an event emitter\nconst messages = app.service('messages');\n\nmessages.on('created', message => console.log('created', message));\n\nmessages.create({\n  text: 'We have to do something!'\n});\n\nupdated, patched\nThe updated and patched events will fire with the callback data when a service update or patch method calls back successfully.\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst app = feathers();\n\napp.use('/my/messages/', {\n  update(id, data) {\n    return Promise.resolve(data);\n  },\n\n  patch(id, data) {\n    return Promise.resolve(data);\n  }\n});\n\nconst messages = app.service('my/messages');\n\nmessages.on('updated', message => console.log('updated', message));\nmessages.on('patched', message => console.log('patched', message));\n\nmessages.update(0, {\n  text: 'updated message'\n});\n\nmessages.patch(0, {\n  text: 'patched message'\n});\n\nremoved\nThe removed event will fire with the callback data when a service remove calls back successfully.\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst app = feathers();\n\napp.use('/messages', {\n  remove(id, params) {\n    return Promise.resolve({ id });\n  }\n});\n\nconst messages = app.service('messages');\n\nmessages.on('removed', message => console.log('removed', message));\nmessages.remove(1);\n\nEvent Filtering\nBy default all service events will be sent to all connected clients. In many cases you probably want to be able to only send events to certain clients, say maybe only ones that are authenticated or only users that belong to the same company. The Socket.io and Primus provider add a .filter() service method which can be used to filter events. A filter is a function(data, connection, hook) that runs for every connected client and gets passed\n\ndata - the data to dispatch.\nconnection - the connected socket for which the data is being filtered. This is the feathers property from the Socket.io and Primus middleware and usually contains information like the connected user.\nhook - the hook object from the original method call.\n\nIt either returns the data to dispatch or false if the event should not be dispatched to this client. Returning a Promise that resolves accordingly is also supported.\n\nProTip: Filter functions run for every connected client on every event and should be optimized for speed and chained by granularity. That means that general and quick filters should run first to narrow down the connected clients to then run more involved checks if necessary.\n\nRegistering filters\nThere are several ways filter functions can be registered, very similar to how hooks can be registered.\nconst todos = app.service('todos');\n\n// Register a filter for all events\ntodos.filter(function(data, connection, hook) {});\n\n// Register a filter for the `created` event\ntodos.filter('created', function(data, connection, hook) {});\n\n// Register a filter for the `created` and `updated` event\ntodos.filter({\n  created(data, connection, hook) {},\n  updated(data, connection, hook) {}\n});\n\n// Register a filter chain the `created` and `removed` event\ntodos.filter({\n  created: [ filterA, filterB ],\n  removed: [ filterA, filterB ]\n});\n\nFilter examples\nThe following example filters all events on the messages service if the connection does not have an authenticated user: \nconst messages = app.service('messages');\n\nmessages.filter(function(data, connection) {\n  if(!connection.user) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  return data;\n});\n\nAs mentioned, filters can be chained. So once the previous filter passes (the connection has an authenticated user) we can now filter all connections where the data and the user do not belong to the same company:\n// Blanket filter out all connections that don't belong to the same company\nmessages.filter(function(data, connection) {\n  if(data.company_id !== connection.user.company_id) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  return data;\n});\n\nNow that we know the connection has an authenticated user and the data and the user belong to the same company, we can filter the created event to only be sent if the connections user and the user that created the Message are friends with each other:\n// After that, filter messages, if the user that created it\n// and the connected user aren't friends\nmessages.filter('created', function(data, connection, hook) {\n  // The id of the user that created the todo\n  const messageUserId = hook.params.user._id;\n  // The a list of ids of the connection's user friends\n  const currentUserFriends = connection.user.friends;\n\n  if(currentUserFriends.indexOf(messageUserId) === -1) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  return data;\n});\n\nFiltering Custom Events\nCustom events can be filtered the same way:\napp.service('payments').filter('status', function(data, connection, hook) {\n\n});\n\nCustom events\nBy default, real-time clients will only receive the standard events. However, it is possible to define a list of custom events on a service as service.events that should also be passed.\n\nImportant: The database adapters also take a list of custom events as an initialization option.\n\n\n\nImportant: Custom events can only be sent from the server to the client, not the other way (client to server). Learn more\n\nFor example, a payment service that sends status events to the client while processing a payment could look like this:\nclass PaymentService {\n  constructor() {\n    this.events = ['status'];\n  },\n\n  create(data, params) {\n    createStripeCustomer(params.user).then(customer => {\n      this.emit('status', { status: 'created' });\n      return createPayment(data).then(result => {\n        this.emit('status', { status: 'completed' });\n      });\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nNow clients can listen to the  status event. Custom events can be filtered just like standard events.\n"},"api/errors.html":{"url":"api/errors.html","title":"Errors","keywords":"","body":"Errors\n\n\n\n$ npm install feathers-errors --save\nThe feathers-errors module contains a set of standard error classes used by all other Feathers modules as well as an Express error handler to format those - and other - errors and setting the correct HTTP status codes for REST calls.\nFeathers errors\nThe following error types, all of which are instances of FeathersError are available:\n\nProTip: All of the Feathers plugins will automatically emit the appropriate Feathers errors for you. For example, most of the database adapters will already send Conflict or Unprocessable errors with the validation errors from the ORM.\n\n\nBadRequest: 400\nNotAuthenticated: 401\nPaymentError: 402\nForbidden: 403\nNotFound: 404\nMethodNotAllowed: 405\nNotAcceptable: 406\nTimeout: 408\nConflict: 409\nUnprocessable: 422\nGeneralError: 500\nNotImplemented: 501\nUnavailable: 503\n\nFeathers errors are pretty flexible. They contain the following fields:\n\ntype - FeathersError\nname - The error name (ie. \"BadRequest\", \"ValidationError\", etc.)\nmessage - The error message string\ncode - The HTTP status code\nclassName - A CSS class name that can be handy for styling errors based on the error type. (ie. \"bad-request\" , etc.)\ndata - An object containing anything you passed to a Feathers error except for the errors object.\nerrors - An object containing whatever was passed to a Feathers error inside errors. This is typically validation errors or if you want to group multiple errors together.\n\n\nProTip: To convert a Feathers error back to an object call error.toJSON(). A normal console.log of a JavaScript Error object will not automatically show those additional properties described above (even though they can be accessed directly).\n\nHere are a few ways that you can use them:\nconst errors = require('feathers-errors');\n\n// If you were to create an error yourself.\nconst notFound = new errors.NotFound('User does not exist');\n\n// You can wrap existing errors\nconst existing = new errors.GeneralError(new Error('I exist'));\n\n// You can also pass additional data\nconst data = new errors.BadRequest('Invalid email', {\n  email: 'sergey@google.com'\n});\n\n// You can also pass additional data without a message\nconst dataWithoutMessage = new errors.BadRequest({\n  email: 'sergey@google.com'\n});\n\n// If you need to pass multiple errors\nconst validationErrors = new errors.BadRequest('Invalid Parameters', {\n  errors: { email: 'Email already taken' }\n});\n\n// You can also omit the error message and we'll put in a default one for you\nconst validationErrors = new errors.BadRequest({\n  errors: {\n    email: 'Invalid Email'\n  }\n});\n\nServer Side Errors\nPromises swallow errors if you forget to add a catch() statement. Therefore, you should make sure that you always call .catch() on your promises. To catch uncaught errors at a global level you can add the code below to your top-most file.\nprocess.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, p) => {\n  console.log('Unhandled Rejection at: Promise ', p, ' reason: ', reason);\n});\n\nREST (Express) errors\nThe separate feathers-errors/handler module is an Express error handler middleware that formats any error response to a REST call as JSON (or HTML if e.g. someone hits our API directly in the browser) and sets the appropriate error code.\n\nProTip: Because Feathers extends Express you can use any Express compatible error middleware with Feathers. In fact, the error handler bundled with feathers-errors is just a slightly customized one.\n\n\n\nVery Important: Just as in Express, the error handler has to be registered after all middleware and services.\n\napp.use(handler())\nSet up the error handler with the default configuration.\nconst errorHandler = require('feathers-errors/handler');\nconst app = feathers();\n\n// before starting the app\napp.use(errorHandler())\n\napp.use(handler(options))\nconst error = require('feathers-errors/handler');\nconst app = feathers();\n\n// Just like Express your error middleware needs to be\n// set up last in your middleware chain.\napp.use(error({\n    html: function(error, req, res, next) {\n      // render your error view with the error object\n      res.render('error', error);\n    }\n}))\n\n\nProTip: If you want to have the response in json format be sure to set the Accept header in your request to application/json otherwise the default error handler will return HTML.\n\nThe following options can be passed when creating a new localstorage service:\n\nhtml (Function|Object) [optional] - A custom formatter function or an object that contains the path to your custom html error pages.\n\n\nProTip: html can also be set to false to disable html error pages altogether so that only JSON is returned.\n\n"},"api/rest.html":{"url":"api/rest.html","title":"REST","keywords":"","body":"REST\n\n\n\n$ npm install feathers-rest --save\nThe feathers-rest module allows you to expose and consume services through a RESTful API. This means that you can call a service method through the GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE HTTP methods:\n\n\n\nService method\nHTTP method\nPath\n\n\n\n\n.find()\nGET\n/messages\n\n\n.get()\nGET\n/messages/1\n\n\n.create()\nPOST\n/messages\n\n\n.update()\nPUT\n/messages/1\n\n\n.patch()\nPATCH\n/messages/1\n\n\n.remove()\nDELETE\n/messages/1\n\n\n\nServer\nTo expose services through a RESTful API we will have to configure the feathers-rest plugin and provide our own body parser middleware (usually the standard Express 4 body-parser) to make REST .create, .update and .patch calls parse the data in the HTTP body. If you would like to add other middleware before the REST handler, call app.use(middleware) before registering any services. \n$ npm install body-parser --save\n\nImportant: For additional information about middleware, routing and how the REST module works with Express middleware see the Express chapter.\n\n\n\nProTip: The body-parser middleware has to be registered before any service. Otherwise the service method will throw a No data provided or First parameter for 'create' must be an object error.\n\napp.configure(rest())\nConfigures the transport provider with a standard formatter sending JSON response via res.json.\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest');\nconst app = feathers();\n\n// Turn on JSON parser for REST services\napp.use(bodyParser.json())\n// Turn on URL-encoded parser for REST services\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n// Set up REST transport\napp.configure(rest())\n\napp.configure(rest(formatter))\nThe default REST response formatter is a middleware that formats the data retrieved by the service as JSON. If you would like to configure your own formatter middleware pass a formatter(req, res) function. This middleware will have access to res.data which is the data returned by the service. res.format can be used for content negotiation.\nconst app = feathers();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest');\n\n// Turn on JSON parser for REST services\napp.use(bodyParser.json())\n// Turn on URL-encoded parser for REST services\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n// Set up REST transport\napp.configure(rest(function(req, res) {\n  // Format the message as text/plain\n  res.format({\n    'text/plain': function() {\n      res.end(`The Message is: \"${res.data.text}\"`);\n    }\n  });  \n}))\n\nparams.query\nparams.query will contain the URL query parameters sent from the client. For the REST transport the query string is parsed using the qs module. For some query string examples see the database querying chapter.\n\nImportant: Only params.query is passed between the server and the client, other parts of params are not. This is for security reasons so that a client can't set things like params.user or the database options. You can always map from params.query to other params properties in a before hook.\n\nparams.provider\nFor any service method call made through REST params.provider will be set to rest. In a hook this can for example be used to prevent external users from making a service method call:\napp.service('users').hooks({\n  before: {\n    remove(hook) {\n      // check for if(hook.params.provider) to prevent any external call\n      if(hook.params.provider === 'rest') {\n        throw new Error('You can not delete a user via REST');\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nClient\nThe client module in feathers-rest (require('feathers-rest/client')) allows to connect to a service exposed through the REST server using jQuery, request, Superagent, Axios or Fetch as the AJAX library.\n\nVery important: The examples below assume you are using Feathers either in Node or in the browser with a module loader like Webpack or Browserify. For using Feathers with a  tag, AMD modules or with React Native see the client chapter.\n\n\n\nProTip: REST client services do emit created, updated, patched and removed events but only locally for their own instance. Real-time events from other clients can only be received by using a websocket connection.\n\n\n\nNote: A client application can only use a single transport (either REST, Socket.io or Primus). Using two transports in the same client application is normally not necessary.\n\nrest([baseUrl])\nREST client services can be initialized by loading feathers-rest/client and initializing a client object with a base URL:\nconst feathers = require('feathers/client');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest/client');\n\n// Connect to REST endpoints\nconst restClient = rest();\n// Connect to a different URL\nconst restClient = rest('http://feathers-api.com');\n\n\n\nProTip: The base URL is relative from where services are registered. That means that a service at http://api.feathersjs.com/api/v1/messages with a base URL of http://api.feathersjs.com would be available as app.service('api/v1/messages'). With a base URL of http://api.feathersjs.com/api/v1 it would be app.service('messages').\n\nREST client wrappers are always initialized using a base URL:\napp.configure(restClient.superagent(superagent [, options]));\n\nDefault headers can be set for all libaries (except request which has its own defaults mechanism) in the options like this:\napp.configure(restClient.superagent(superagent, {\n  headers: { 'X-Requested-With': 'FeathersJS' }\n}));\n\nThen services that automatically connect to that remote URL can be retrieved as usual via app.service:\napp.service('messages').create({\n  text: 'A message from a REST client'\n});\n\nRequest specific headers can be through params.headers in a service call:\napp.service('messages').create({\n  text: 'A message from a REST client'\n}, {\n  headers: { 'X-Requested-With': 'FeathersJS' }\n});\n\nThe supported AJAX libraries can be initialized as follows.\njQuery\nPass the instance of jQuery ($) to restClient.jquery:\napp.configure(restClient.jquery(window.jQuery));\n\nOr with a module loader:\nimport $ from 'jquery';\n\napp.configure(restClient.jquery($));\n\nRequest\nThe request object needs to be passed explicitly to feathers.request. Using request.defaults - which creates a new request object - is a great way to set things like default headers or authentication information:\nconst request = require('request');\nconst client = request.defaults({\n  'auth': {\n    'user': 'username',\n    'pass': 'password',\n    'sendImmediately': false\n  }\n});\n\napp.configure(restClient.request(client));\n\nSuperagent\nSuperagent currently works with a default configuration:\nconst superagent = require('superagent');\n\napp.configure(restClient.superagent(superagent));\n\nAxios\nAxios currently works with a default configuration:\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\napp.configure(restClient.axios(axios));\n\nFetch\nFetch also uses a default configuration:\nconst fetch = require('node-fetch');\n\napp.configure(restClient.fetch(fetch));\n\nDirect connection\nYou can communicate with a Feathers server using any HTTP REST client. The following section describes what HTTP method, body and query parameters belong to which service method call.\nAll query parameters in a URL will be set as params.query on the server. Other service parameters can be set through hooks and Express middleware. URL query parameter values will always be strings. Conversion (e.g. the string 'true' to boolean true) can be done in a hook as well.\nThe body type for POST, PUT and PATCH requests is determined by the Express body-parser middleware which has to be registered before any service. You should also make sure you are setting your Accept header to application/json.\nfind\nRetrieves a list of all matching resources from the service\nGET /messages?status=read&user=10\nWill call messages.find({ query: { status: 'read', user: '10' } }) on the server.\nIf you want to use any of the built-in find operands ($le, $lt, $ne, $eq, $in, etc.) the general format is as follows:\nGET /messages?field[$operand]=value&field[$operand]=value2\nFor example, to find the records where field status is not equal to active you could do\nGET /messages?status[$ne]=active\nMore information about the possible parameters for official database adapters can be found in the database querying section.\nget\nRetrieve a single resource from the service.\nGET /messages/1\nWill call messages.get(1, {}) on the server.\nGET /messages/1?fetch=all\nWill call messages.get(1, { query: { fetch: 'all' } }) on the server.\ncreate\nCreate a new resource with data which may also be an array.\nPOST /messages\n{ \"text\": \"I really have to iron\" }\nWill call messages.create({ \"text\": \"I really have to iron\" }, {}) on the server.\nPOST /messages\n[\n  { \"text\": \"I really have to iron\" },\n  { \"text\": \"Do laundry\" }\n]\nupdate\nCompletely replace a single or multiple resources.\nPUT /messages/2\n{ \"text\": \"I really have to do laundry\" }\nWill call messages.update(2, { \"text\": \"I really have to do laundry\" }, {}) on the server. When no id is given by sending the request directly to the endpoint something like:\nPUT /messages?complete=false\n{ \"complete\": true }\nWill call messages.update(null, { \"complete\": true }, { query: { complete: 'false' } }) on the server.\n\nProTip: update is normally expected to replace an entire resource which is why the database adapters only support patch for multiple records.\n\npatch\nMerge the existing data of a single or multiple resources with the new data.\nPATCH /messages/2\n{ \"read\": true }\nWill call messages.patch(2, { \"read\": true }, {}) on the server. When no id is given by sending the request directly to the endpoint something like:\nPATCH /messages?complete=false\n{ \"complete\": true }\nWill call messages.patch(null, { complete: true }, { query: { complete: 'false' } }) on the server to change the status for all read messages.\nThis is supported out of the box by the Feathers database adapters \nremove\nRemove a single or multiple resources:\nDELETE /messages/2?cascade=true\nWill call messages.remove(2, { query: { cascade: 'true' } }).\nWhen no id is given by sending the request directly to the endpoint something like:\nDELETE /messages?read=true\nWill call messages.remove(null, { query: { read: 'true' } }) to delete all read messages.\n"},"api/express.html":{"url":"api/express.html","title":"Express","keywords":"","body":"Express\nOn the server, a Feathers application acts as a drop-in replacement for any Express application. This chapter describes how services and the REST transport interact with Express middleware.\n\nImportant: This chapter assumes that you are familiar with Express.\n\nSetting service params\nAll middleware registered after the REST transport will have access to the req.feathers object to set properties on the service method params:\nconst app = require('feathers')();\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\napp.configure(rest())\n  .use(bodyParser.json())\n  .use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))\n  .use(function(req, res, next) {\n    req.feathers.fromMiddleware = 'Hello world';\n    next();\n  });\n\napp.use('/todos', {\n  get(id, params) {\n    console.log(params.provider); // -> 'rest'\n    console.log(params.fromMiddleware); // -> 'Hello world'\n\n    return Promise.resolve({\n      id, params,\n      description: `You have to do ${id}!`\n    });\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3030);\n\nYou can see the parameters set by running the example and visiting http://localhost:3030/todos/test.\nAvoid setting req.feathers = something directly since it may already contain information that other Feathers plugins rely on. Adding individual properties or using Object.assign(req.feathers, something) is the more reliable option.\n\nProTip: Although it may be convenient to set req.feathers.req = req; to have access to the request object in the service, we recommend keeping your services as provider independent as possible. There usually is a way to pre-process your data in a middleware so that the service does not need to know about the HTTP request or response.\n\nQuery parameters\nThe query string is parsed using the qs module. URL query parameters will be parsed and passed to the service as params.query. For example:\nGET /messages?read=true&$sort[createdAt]=-1\nWill set params.query to\n{\n  \"read\": \"true\",\n  \"$sort\": { \"createdAt\": \"-1\" }\n}\n\nFor additional query string examples see the database querying chapter.\n\nProTip: Since the URL is just a string, there will be no type conversion. This can be done manually in a hook.\n\n\n\nProTip: If an array in your request consists of more than 20 items, the qs parser implicitly converts it  to an object with indices as keys. To extend this limit, you can set a custom query parser: app.set('query parser', str => qs.parse(str, {arrayLimit: 1000}))\n\nRoute parameters\nExpress route placeholder parameters in a service URL will be added to the service params:\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest');\n\nconst app = feathers();\n\napp.configure(rest())\n  .use(function(req, res, next) {\n    req.feathers.fromMiddleware = 'Hello world';\n    next();\n  });\n\napp.use('/users/:userId/messages', {\n  get(id, params) {\n    console.log(params.query); // -> ?query\n    console.log(params.provider); // -> 'rest'\n    console.log(params.fromMiddleware); // -> 'Hello world'\n    console.log(params.userId); // will be `1` for GET /users/1/messages\n\n    return Promise.resolve({\n      id,\n      params,\n      read: false,\n      text: `Feathers is great!`,\n      createdAt: new Date().getTime()\n    });\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3030);\n\nYou can see all the passed parameters by going to something like localhost:3030/users/213/messages/23?read=false&$sort[createdAt]=-1].\nCustom service middleware\nCustom Express middleware that only should run before or after a specific service can be passed to app.use in the order it should run:\nconst todoService = {\n  get(id) {\n    return Promise.resolve({\n      id,\n      description: `You have to do ${id}!`\n    });\n  }\n};\n\napp.use('/todos', ensureAuthenticated, logRequest, todoService, updateData);\n\nMiddleware that runs after the service will have res.data available which is the data returned by the service. For example updateData could look like this:\nfunction updateData(req, res, next) {\n  res.data.updateData = true;\n  next();\n}\n\nInformation about how to use a custom formatter (e.g. to send something other than JSON) can be found in the REST transport chapter.\nSub-Apps\nSub-apps allow to provide different versions for an API. Currently, when using the Socket.io and Primus real-time providers providers, app.setup will be called automatically, however, with only the REST provider or when using plain Express in the parent application you will have to call the sub-apps setup yourself:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst api = feathers().use('/service', myService);\n\nconst mainApp = express().use('/api/v1', api);\n\nconst server = mainApp.listen(3030);\n\n// Now call setup on the Feathers app with the server\napi.setup(server);\n\n\nProTip: We recommend avoiding complex sub-app setups because websockets and Feathers built in authentication are not fully sub-app aware.\n\nHTTPS\nWith your Feathers application initialized it is easy to set up an HTTPS REST and SocketIO server:\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst https  = require('https');\n\napp.configure(socketio()).use('/todos', todoService);\n\nconst server = https.createServer({\n  key: fs.readFileSync('privatekey.pem'),\n  cert: fs.readFileSync('certificate.pem')\n}, app).listen(443);\n\n// Call app.setup to initialize all services and SocketIO\napp.setup(server);\n\nVirtual Hosts\nYou can use the vhost middleware to run your Feathers app on a virtual host:\nconst vhost = require('vhost');\n\napp.use('/todos', todoService);\n\nconst host = feathers().use(vhost('foo.com', app));\nconst server = host.listen(8080);\n\n// Here we need to call app.setup because .listen on our virtal hosted\n// app is never called\napp.setup(server);\n\n"},"api/socketio.html":{"url":"api/socketio.html","title":"Socket.io","keywords":"","body":"Socket.io\n\n\n\n$ npm install feathers-socketio --save\nThe feathers-socketio module allows to call service methods and receive real-time events via Socket.io, a NodeJS library which enables real-time bi-directional, event-based communication.\n\n\n\nService method\nMethod event name\nReal-time event\n\n\n\n\n.find()\nmessages::find\n-\n\n\n.get()\nmessages::get\n-\n\n\n.create()\nmessages::create\nmessages created\n\n\n.update()\nmessages::update\nmessages updated\n\n\n.patch()\nmessages::patch\nmessages patched\n\n\n.remove()\nmessages::removed\nmessages removed\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Socket.io is also used to call service methods.

You can set the timeout either through the option above or on a per-service level by setting the timeout property:\napp.service('messages').timeout = 3000;\n\nDirect connection\nFeathers sets up a normal Socket.io server that you can connect to with any Socket.io compatible client, usually the Socket.io client either by loading the socket.io-client module or /socket.io/socket.io.js from the server. Unlike HTTP calls, websockets do not have an inherent cross-origin restriction in the browser so it is possible to connect to any Feathers server.\n\nProTip: The socket connection URL has to point to the server root which is where Feathers will set up Socket.io.\n\n\n\n\n  var socket = io();\n\n\n\n\n\n  var socket = io('http://localhost:3030/');\n\n\nCalling service methods\nService methods can be called by emitting a :: event with the method parameters. servicepath is the name the service has been registered with (in app.use) without leading or trailing slashes. An optional callback following the function(error, data) Node convention will be called with the result of the method call or any errors that might have occurred.\nparams will be set as params.query in the service method call.

The id can also be null to update multiple resources:\nsocket.emit('messages::update', null, {\n  complete: true\n}, { complete: false });\n\nWill call messages.update(null, { \"complete\": true }, { query: { complete: 'false' } }) on the server.\n\nProTip: update is normally expected to replace an entire resource which is why the database adapters only support patch for multiple records.\n\npatch\nMerge the existing data of a single or multiple resources with the new data.\nsocket.emit('messages::patch', 2, {\n  read: true\n}, (error, message) => {\n  console.log('Patched message', message);\n});\n\nWill call messages.patch(2, { \"read\": true }, {}) on the server. The id can also be null to update multiple resources:\nsocket.emit('messages::patch', null, {\n  complete: true\n}, {\n  complete: false\n}, (error, message) => {\n  console.log('Patched message', message);\n});\n\nWill call messages.patch(null, { complete: true }, { query: { complete: false } }) on the server to change the status for all read messages.\nThis is supported out of the box by the Feathers database adapters \nremove\nRemove a single or multiple resources:\nsocket.emit('messages::remove', 2, { cascade: true }, (error, message) => {\n  console.log('Removed a message', message);\n});\n\nWill call messages.remove(2, { query: { cascade: true } }) on the server. The id can also be null to remove multiple resources:\nsocket.emit('messages::remove', null, { read: true });\n\nWill call messages.remove(null, { query: { read: 'true' } }) on the server to delete all read messages.\nListening to events\nListening to service events allows real-time behaviour in an application. Service events are sent to the socket in the form of servicepath eventname.\ncreated\nThe created event will be published with the callback data when a service create returns successfully.\nvar socket = io('http://localhost:3030/');\n\nsocket.on('messages created', function(message) {\n  console.log('Got a new Todo!', message);\n});\n\nupdated, patched\nThe updated and patched events will be published with the callback data when a service update or patch method calls back successfully.\nvar socket = io('http://localhost:3030/');\n\nsocket.on('my/messages updated', function(message) {\n  console.log('Got an updated Todo!', message);\n});\n\nsocket.emit('my/messages::update', 1, {\n  text: 'Updated text'\n}, {}, function(error, callback) {\n // Do something here\n});\n\nremoved\nThe removed event will be published with the callback data when a service remove calls back successfully.\nvar socket = io('http://localhost:3030/');\n\nsocket.on('messages removed', function(message) {\n  // Remove element showing the Todo from the page\n  $('#message-' + message.id).remove();\n});\n\n"},"api/primus.html":{"url":"api/primus.html","title":"Primus","keywords":"","body":"Primus\n\n\n\n$ npm install feathers-primus --save\nThe feathers-primus module allows to call service methods and receive real-time events via Primus, a universal wrapper for real-time frameworks that supports Engine.IO, WebSockets, Faye, BrowserChannel, SockJS and Socket.IO.\n\n\n\nService method\nMethod event name\nReal-time event\n\n\n\n\n.find()\nmessages::find\n-\n\n\n.get()\nmessages::get\n-\n\n\n.create()\nmessages::create\nmessages created\n\n\n.update()\nmessages::update\nmessages updated\n\n\n.patch()\nmessages::patch\nmessages patched\n\n\n.remove()\nmessages::removed\nmessages removed\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Primus is also used to call service methods.

This is for security reasons so that a client can't set things like params.user or the database options. You can always map from params.query to params in a before hook.\n\nMiddleware and service parameters\nThe Primus request object has a feathers property that can be extended with additional service params during authorization:\napp.configure(primus({\n  transformer: 'sockjs'\n}, function(primus) {\n  // Do something with primus\n  primus.use('todos::create', function(socket, done){\n    // Exposing a request property to services and hooks\n    socket.request.feathers.referrer = socket.request.referrer;\n    done();\n  });\n}));\n\napp.use('messages', {\n  create(data, params, callback) {\n    // When called via Primus:\n    params.provider // -> primus\n    params.user // -> { name: 'David' }\n  }\n});\n\nClient\nThe client module in feathers-primus (require('feathers-primus/client')) allows to connect to services exposed through the Primus server via a client socket.\n\nVery important: The examples below assume you are using Feathers either in Node or in the browser with a module loader like Webpack or Browserify. For using Feathers with a  tag, AMD modules or with React Native see the client chapter.\n\n\n\nNote: A client application can only use a single transport (either REST, Socket.io or Primus). Using two transports in the same client application is normally not necessary.\n\nLoading the Primus client library\nIn the browser the Primus client library (usually at primus/primus.js) always has to be loaded using a  tag:\n\n\n\nImportant: This will make the Primus object globally available.

It will set the mixed options back on to the app so that they are available at any time by calling app.get('auth'). They can all be overridden and are required by some of the authentication plugins.\n{\n  path: '/authentication', // the authentication service path\n  header: 'Authorization', // the header to use when using JWT auth\n  entity: 'user', // the entity that will be added to the request, socket, and hook.params.

Will also include an exp property denoting the expiry timestamp.\noptions {Object} - the options passed to jsonwebtoken sign()\nsecret {String | Buffer} - either the secret for HMAC algorithms, or the PEM encoded private key for RSA and ECDSA.\njwt - See the jsonwebtoken package docs for other available options. The authenticate method uses the default jwt options. When using this package, directly, they will have to be passed in manually.\n\n\n\nThe returned promise resolves with the JWT or fails with an error.\napp.passport.verifyJWT(token, options) source\nVerifies the signature and payload of the passed in JWT token using the options.\n\ntoken {JWT} - the JWT to be verified.\noptions {Object} the options passed to jsonwebtoken verify()\nsecret {String | Buffer} - - either the secret for HMAC algorithms, or the PEM encoded private key for RSA and ECDSA.\nSee the jsonwebtoken package docs for other available options.\n\n\n\nThe authentication service\nThe heart of this plugin is simply a service for creating JWT.  It's a normal Feathers service that implements only the create and remove methods.  The /authentication service provides all of the functionality that the /auth/local and /auth/token endpoints did.  To choose a strategy, the client must pass the strategy name in the request body.  This will be different based on the plugin used.  See the documentation for the plugins listed at the top of this page for more information.\napp.service('/authentication').create(data, params)\nThe create method will be used in nearly every Feathers application.  It creates a JWT based on the jwt options configured on the plugin.  The API of this method utilizes the hook object:\nbefore hook API:\nThese properties can be modified to change the behavior of the /authentication service.\n\nhook.data.payload {Object} - determines the payload of the JWT\nhook.params.payload {Object} - also determines the payload of the JWT. Any matching attributes in the hook.data.payload will be overwritten by these. Persists into after hooks.\nhook.params.authenticated {Boolean} - After successful authentication, will be set to true, unless it's set to false in a before hook.  If you set it to false in a before hook, it will prevent the websocket from being flagged as authenticated. Persists into after hooks.\n\nafter hook API:\n\nhook.params[entity] {Object} - After successful authentication, the entity looked up from the database will be populated here. (The default option is user.)\n\napp.service('/authentication').remove(data)\nThe remove method will be used less often.  It mostly exists to allow for adding hooks the the \"logout\" process.  For example, in services that require high control over security, a developer could register hooks on the remove method that perform token blacklisting.\nafter hook API:\n\nhook.result {Object} - After logout, useful information regarding the previous session will be populated here.\n\nBelow is the example of the hook usage:\n    after: {\n      remove: [\n        function (hook) {\n          return app.passport.verifyJWT(hook.result.accessToken, { secret: app.passport.options('jwt').secret })\n              .then((data) => {\n                // removing the user who decided to logout\n                app.service('users').remove(data.userId).then(() => {\n                  return hook;\n                });\n              });\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nThe authenticate hook\nauth.hooks.authenticate(strategies), where strategies is an array of passport strategy names.\nfeathers-authentication only includes a single hook. This bundled authenticate hook is used to register an array of authentication strategies on a service method.  When authenticating, the client must send the strategy as part of the payload.\n\nNote: This should usually be used on your /authentication service. Without it you can hit the authentication service and generate a JWT accessToken without authentication (ie. anonymous authentication).\n\napp.service('authentication').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      // You can chain multiple strategies\n      auth.hooks.authenticate(['jwt', 'local']),\n    ],\n    remove: [\n      auth.hooks.authenticate('jwt')\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nThe hooks that were once bundled with this module are now located at feathers-authentication-hooks.\nAuthentication Events\nThe login and logout events are emitted on the app object whenever a client successfully authenticates or \"logs out\". (With JWT, logging out doesn't invalidate the JWT.  Read the section about how JWT work for more information.) These events are only emitted on the server.\napp.on('login', callback)) and app.on('logout', callback))\nThese two events use a callback with the same signature.\n\ncallback {Function} - a function in the format function (result, meta) {}.\n\nresult {Object} - The final hook.result from the authentication service. Unless you customize the hook.response in an after hook, this will only contain the accessToken, which is the JWT.\nmeta {Object} - information about the request.  The meta data varies per transport / provider as follows.\nUsing feathers-rest\nprovider {String} - will always be \"rest\"\nreq {Object} - the Express request object.\nres {Object} - the Express response object.\n\n\nUsing feathers-socketio and feathers-primus:\nprovider {String} - the transport name: socketio or primus\nconnection {Object} - the same as params in the hook context\nsocket {SocketObject} - the current user's WebSocket object.  It also contains the feathers attribute, which is the same as params in the hook context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpress Middleware\nThere is an authenticate middleware. It is used the exact same way you would the regular Passport express middleware:\napp.post('/login', auth.express.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/app', failureRedirect: '/login' }));\n\nAdditional middleware are included and exposed but typically you don't need to worry about them:\n\nemitEvents source - emit login and logout events\nexposeCookies source - expose cookies to Feathers so they are available to hooks and services.  This is NOT used by default as its use exposes your API to CSRF vulnerabilities.  Only use it if you really know what you're doing.\nexposeHeaders source - expose headers to Feathers so they are available to hooks and services. This is NOT used by default as its use exposes your API to CSRF vulnerabilities. Only use it if you really know what you're doing.\nfailureRedirect source - support redirecting on auth failure. Only triggered if hook.redirect is set.\nsuccessRedirect source - support redirecting on auth success. Only triggered if hook.redirect is set.\nsetCookie source - support setting the JWT access token in a cookie. Only enabled if cookies are enabled.  Note: Feathers will NOT read an access token from a cookie.  This would expose the API to CSRF attacks.  This setCookie feature is available primarily for helping with Server Side Rendering.\n\nMigrating to 1.x\nRefer to the migration guide.\nComplete Example\nHere's an example of a Feathers server that uses feathers-authentication for local auth.

It simply makes it easier to implement authentication in your client by automatically storing and sending the JWT access token and handling re-authenticating when a websocket disconnects.\nAPI\nThis module contains:\n\nThe main entry function\nAdditional feathersClient methods\nSome helpful hooks\n\nConfiguration\nfeathersClient.configure(auth(options))\nSetup is done the same as all Feathers plugins, using the configure method:\nimport auth from 'feathers-authentication-client';\n\n// Available options are listed in the \"Default Options\" section\nfeathersClient.configure(auth(options))\n\n\nThe transports plugins must have been initialized previously to the authentication plugin on the client side\n\nDefault options\nThe following default options will be mixed in with the settings you pass in when configuring authentication. It will set the mixed options back to to the app so that they are available at any time by app.get('auth'). They can all be overridden.\n{\n  header: 'Authorization', // the default authorization header for REST\n  path: '/authentication', // the server-side authentication service path\n  jwtStrategy: 'jwt', // the name of the JWT authentication strategy \n  entity: 'user', // the entity you are authenticating (ie. a users)\n  service: 'users', // the service to look up the entity\n  cookie: 'feathers-jwt', // the name of the cookie to parse the JWT from when cookies are enabled server side\n  storageKey: 'feathers-jwt', // the key to store the accessToken in localstorage or AsyncStorage on React Native\n  storage: undefined // Passing a WebStorage-compatible object to enable automatic storage on the client.\n}\n\nTo enable localStorage on the client, be sure to set storage: window.localStorage in the client options.  You can also provide other WebStorage-compatible objects.  Here are a couple of useful storage packages:\n\nlocalForage helps deal with older browsers and browsers in Incognito / Private Browsing mode.\ncookie-storage uses cookies. It can be useful devices that don't support localStorage.\n\nAdditional feathersClient methods\nAfter configuring this plugin, the Feathers client will have a few additional methods:\nfeathersClient.authenticate(options) source\nAuthenticate with a Feathers server by passing a strategy and other properties as credentials. It will use whichever transport has been setup on the client (feathers-rest, feathers-socketio, or feathers-primus). Returns a Promise.\nfeathersClient.authenticate({\n  strategy: 'jwt', \n  accessToken: ''\n})\n\n\ndata {Object} - of the format {strategy [, ...otherProps]}\nstrategy {String} - the name of the strategy to be used to authenticate.  Required.\n...otherProps {Properties} vary depending on the chosen strategy. Above is an example of using the jwt strategy.  Below is one for the local strategy.\n\n\n\nfeathersClient.authenticate({\n  strategy: 'local',\n  email: 'my@email.com',\n  password: 'my-password'\n})\n\nWhen using feathers-socketio or feathers-primus, the WebSocket connection has to be authenticated by calling app.authenticate() in order to make requests using a stored accessToken.\napp.authenticate().then(response => {\n  /* make authenticated requests here */\n  return response\n})\n\nfeathersClient.logout() source\nRemoves the JWT accessToken from storage on the client.  It also calls the remove method of the /authentication service on the Feathers server.\nfeathersClient.passport.getJWT() source\nPull the JWT from localstorage or the cookie. Returns a Promise.\nfeathersClient.passport.verifyJWT(token) source\nVerify that a JWT is not expired and decode it to get the payload. Returns a Promise.\nfeathersClient.passport.payloadIsValid(token) source\nSynchronously verify that a token has not expired. Returns a Boolean.\nHooks\nThere are 3 hooks. They are really meant for internal use and you shouldn't need to worry about them very often.\n\npopulateAccessToken - Takes the token and puts in on hooks.params.accessToken in case you need it in one of your client side services or hooks\npopulateHeader - Add the accessToken to the authorization header\npopulateEntity - Experimental. Populate an entity based on the JWT payload.\n\nComplete Example\nHere's an example of a Feathers server that uses feathers-authentication-client. \nconst feathers = require('feathers/client');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest/client');\nconst superagent = require('superagent');\nconst hooks = require('feathers-hooks');\nconst localStorage = require('localstorage-memory');\nconst auth = require('feathers-authentication-client');\n\nconst feathersClient = feathers();\n\nfeathersClient.configure(hooks())\n  .configure(rest('http://localhost:3030').superagent(superagent))\n  .configure(auth({ storage: localStorage }));\n\nfeathersClient.authenticate({\n  strategy: 'local',\n  email: 'admin@feathersjs.com',\n  password: 'admin'\n})\n.then(response => {\n  console.log('Authenticated!', response);\n  return feathersClient.passport.verifyJWT(response.accessToken);\n})\n.then(payload => {\n  console.log('JWT Payload', payload);\n  return feathersClient.service('users').get(payload.userId);\n})\n.then(user => {\n  feathersClient.set('user', user);\n  console.log('User', feathersClient.get('user'));\n})\n.catch(function(error){\n  console.error('Error authenticating!', error);\n});\n\nHandling the special re-authentication errors\nIn the event that your server goes down or the client loses connectivity, it will automatically handle attempting to re-authenticate the socket when the client regains connectivity with the server. In order to handle an authentication failure during automatic re-authentication you need to implement the following event listener:\nconst errorHandler = error => {\n  app.authenticate({\n    strategy: 'local',\n    email: 'admin@feathersjs.com',\n    password: 'admin'\n  }).then(response => {\n    // You are now authenticated again\n  });\n};\n\n// Handle when auth fails during a reconnect or a transport upgrade\napp.on('reauthentication-error', errorHandler)\n\n"},"api/authentication/local.html":{"url":"api/authentication/local.html","title":"Local","keywords":"","body":"Local Authentication\n\n\n\n$ npm install feathers-authentication-local --save\nfeathers-authentication-local is a server side module that wraps the passport-local authentication strategy, which lets you authenticate with your Feathers application using a username and password.\nThis module contains 3 core pieces:\n\nThe main initialization function\nThe hashPassword hook \nThe Verifier class\n\nConfiguration\nIn most cases initializing the module is as simple as doing this:\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst authentication = require('feathers-authentication');\nconst local = require('feathers-authentication-local');\nconst app = feathers();\n\n// Setup authentication\napp.configure(authentication(settings));\napp.configure(local());\n\n// Setup a hook to only allow valid JWTs or successful \n// local auth to authenticate and get new JWT access tokens\napp.service('authentication').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      authentication.hooks.authenticate(['local', 'jwt'])\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nThis will pull from your global authentication object in your config file. It will also mix in the following defaults, which can be customized.\nDefault Options\n{\n    name: 'local', // the name to use when invoking the authentication Strategy\n    entity: 'user', // the entity that you're comparing username/password against\n    service: 'users', // the service to look up the entity\n    usernameField: 'email', // key name of username field\n    passwordField: 'password', // key name of password field\n    passReqToCallback: true, // whether the request object should be passed to `verify`\n    session: false // whether to use sessions,\n    Verifier: Verifier // A Verifier class. Defaults to the built-in one but can be a custom one. See below for details.\n}\n\nhashPassword hook\nThis hook is used to hash plain text passwords before they are saved to the database. It uses the bcrypt algorithm by default but can be customized by passing your own options.hash function.\nconst local = require('feathers-authentication-local');\n\napp.service('users').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      local.hooks.hashPassword()\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nDefault Options\n{\n  passwordField: 'password', // key name of password field to look on hook.data\n  hash: customHashFunction // default is the bcrypt hash function. Takes in a password and returns a hash.\n}\n\nVerifier\nThis is the verification class that does the actual username and password verification by looking up the entity (normally a user) on a given service by the usernameField and compares the hashed password using bcrypt. It has the following methods that can all be overridden. All methods return a promise except verify, which has the exact same signature as passport-local.\n{\n    constructor(app, options) // the class constructor\n    _comparePassword(entity, password) // compares password using bcrypt\n    _normalizeResult(result) // normalizes result from service to account for pagination\n    verify(req, username, password, done) // queries the service and calls the other internal functions.\n}\n\nCustomizing the Verifier\nThe Verifier class can be extended so that you customize it's behavior without having to rewrite and test a totally custom local Passport implementation. Although that is always an option if you don't want use this plugin.\nAn example of customizing the Verifier:\nimport local, { Verifier } from 'feathers-authentication-local';\n\nclass CustomVerifier extends Verifier {\n  // The verify function has the exact same inputs and \n  // return values as a vanilla passport strategy\n  verify(req, username, password, done) {\n    // do your custom stuff. You can call internal Verifier methods\n    // and reference this.app and this.options. This method must be implemented.\n\n    // the 'user' variable can be any truthy value\n    // the 'payload' is the payload for the JWT access token that is generated after successful authentication\n    done(null, user, payload);\n  }\n}\n\napp.configure(local({ Verifier: CustomVerifier }));\n\nClient Usage\nWhen this module is registered server side, using the default config values this is how you can authenticate using feathers-authentication-client:\napp.authenticate({\n  strategy: 'local',\n  email: 'your email',\n  password: 'your password'\n}).then(response => {\n  // You are now authenticated\n});\n\nDirect Usage\nUsing a HTTP Request\nIf you are not using the feathers-authentication-client and you have registered this module server side then you can simply make a POST request to /authentication with the following payload:\n// POST /authentication\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"local\",\n  \"email\": \"your email\",\n  \"password\": \"your password\"\n}\n\nHere is what that looks like with curl:\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -d '{\"strategy\":\"local\",\"email\":\"your email\",\"password\":\"your password\"}' http://localhost:3030/authentication\n\nUsing Sockets\nAuthenticating using a local strategy via sockets is done by emitting the following message:\nconst io = require('socket.io-client');\nconst socket = io('http://localhost:3030');\n\nsocket.emit('authenticate', {\n  strategy: 'local',\n  email: 'your email',\n  password: 'your password'\n}, function(message, data) {\n  console.log(message); // message will be null\n  console.log(data); // data will be {\"accessToken\": \"your token\"}\n  // You can now send authenticated messages to the server\n});\n\n"},"api/authentication/local-management.html":{"url":"api/authentication/local-management.html","title":"Local management","keywords":"","body":"Local Authentication Management\n$ npm install feathers-authentication-management --save\nSign up verification, forgotten password reset, and other capabilities for local authentication.\nMultiple communication channels:\nTraditionally users have been authenticated using their username or email.\nHowever that landscape is changing.\nTeens are more involved with cellphone SMS, whatsapp, facebook, QQ and wechat than they are with email.\nSeniors may not know how to create an email account or check email, but they have smart phones\nand perhaps whatsapp or wechat accounts.\nA more flexible design would maintain multiple communication channels for a user\n-- username, email address, phone number, handles for whatsapp, facebook, QQ, wechat --\nwhich each uniquely identify the user.\nThe user could then sign in using any of their unique identifiers.\nThe user could also indicate how they prefer to be contacted.\nSome may prefer to get password resets via long tokens sent by email;\nothers may prefer short numeric tokens sent by SMS or wechat.\nfeathers-authentication and feathers-authentication-management\nprovide much of the infrastructure necessary to implement such a scenario. \nCapabilities:\n\nChecking that values for fields like username, email, cellphone are unique within users items.\nHooks for adding a new user.\nSend another sign up verification notification, routing through user's selected transport.\nProcess a sign up or identity change verification from a URL response.\nProcess a sign up or identity change verification using a short token.\nSend a forgotten password reset notification, routing through user's preferred communication transport.\nProcess a forgotten password reset from a URL response.\nProcess a forgotten password reset using a short token.\nProcess password change.\nProcess an identity change such as a new email addr, or cellphone.\n\nUser notifications may be sent for:\n\nSign up verification when a new user is created.\nResending a signup verification, e.g. previous verification was lost or is expired.\nSuccessful user verification.\nResetting the password when the password is forgotten.\nSuccessful password reset for a forgotten password.\nManual change of a password.\nChange of identity.\nNotify both the current and new e.g. old email addr may be notified when the email addr changes.\n\nMay be used with\n\nfeathers-client service calls over websockets or HTTP.\nClient side wrappers for feathers-client service calls. \nHTTP POST calls.\nReact's Redux.\nVue (docs to do)\n\nVarious-sized tokens can be used during the verify/reset processes:\nA 30-char token is generated suitable for URL responses.\n(Configurable length.)\nThis may be embedded in URL links sent by email, SMS or social media\nso that clicking the link starts the sign up verification or the password reset.\nA 6-digit token is also generated suitable for notification by SMS or social media.\n(Configurable length, may be alpha-numeric instead.)\nThis may be manually entered in a UI to start the sign up verification or the password reset.\nThe email verification token has a 5-day expiry (configurable),\nwhile the password reset has a 2 hour expiry (configurable).\nTypically your notifier routine refers to a property like user.preferredComm: 'email'\nto determine which transport to use for user notification.\nHowever the API allows the UI to be set up to ask the user which transport they prefer for that time.\nThe server does not handle any interactions with the user.\nLeaving it a pure API server, lets it be used with both native and browser clients.\nContents\n\nThe Service\nClient\nUsing Feathers' method calls\nProvided service wrappers\nReact's redux\nDispatching services\nDispatching authentication\n\n\n\n\nHooks\nMultiple services\nDatabase\nRouting\nSecurity\nConfigurable\n\nService\nimport authManagement from 'feathers-authentication-management';\napp.configure(authentication)\n  .configure(authManagement({ options }))\n  .configure(user);\n\noptions are:\n\nservice: The path of the service for user items, e.g. /users (default) or /organization.\npath: The path to associate with this service.

We recommend being familiar with services, service events and hooks before using a database adapter.\n\nInitialization\nservice([options])\nReturns a new service instance initialized with the given options.\nconst service = require('feathers-');\n\napp.use('/messages', service());\napp.use('/messages', service({ id, events, paginate }));\n\nOptions:\n\nid (optional) - The name of the id field property (usually set by default to id or _id).\nevents (optional) - A list of custom service events sent by this service\npaginate (optional) - A pagination object containing a default and max page size\n\nPagination\nWhen initializing an adapter you can set the following pagination options in the paginate object:\n\ndefault - Sets the default number of items when $limit is not set\nmax - Sets the maximum allowed number of items per page (even if the $limit query parameter is set higher)\n\nWhen paginate.default is set, find will return an page object (instead of the normal array) in the following form:\n{\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"limit\": \"\",\n  \"skip\": \"\",\n  \"data\": [/* data */]\n}\nThe pagination options can be set as follows:\nconst service = require('feathers-');\n\n// Set the `paginate` option during initialization\napp.use('/todos', service({\n  paginate: {\n    default: 5,\n    max: 25\n  }\n}));\n\n// override pagination in `params.paginate` for this call\napp.service('todos').find({\n  paginate: {\n    default: 100,\n    max: 200\n  }\n});\n\n// disable pagination for this call\napp.service('todos').find({\n  paginate: false\n});\n\n\nNote: Disabling or changing the default pagination is not available in the client. Only params.query is passed to the server (also see a workaround here)\nPro tip: To just get the number of available records set $limit to 0. This will only run a (fast) counting query against the database.\n\nService methods\nThis section describes specifics on how the service methods are implemented for all adapters.\nadapter.find(params) -> Promise\nReturns a list of all records matching the query in params.query using the common querying mechanism. Will either return an array with the results or a page object if pagination is enabled.\n\nImportant: When used via REST URLs all query values are strings. Depending on the database the values in params.query might have to be converted to the right type in a before hook.\n\n// Find all messages for user with id 1\napp.service('messages').find({\n  query: {\n    userId: 1\n  }\n}).then(messages => console.log(messages));\n\n// Find all messages belonging to room 1 or 3\napp.service('messages').find({\n  query: {\n    roomId: {\n      $in: [ 1, 3 ]\n    }\n  }\n}).then(messages => console.log(messages));\n\nFind all messages for user with id 1\nGET /messages?userId=1\nFind all messages belonging to room 1 or 3\nGET /messages?roomId[$in]=1&roomId[$in]=3\nadapter.get(id, params) -> Promise\nRetrieve a single record by its unique identifier (the field set in the id option during initialization).\napp.service('messages').get(1)\n  .then(message => console.log(message));\n\nGET /messages/1\nadapter.create(data, params) -> Promise\nCreate a new record with data. data can also be an array to create multiple records.\napp.service('messages').create({\n    text: 'A test message'\n  })\n  .then(message => console.log(message));\n\napp.service('messages').create([{\n    text: 'Hi'\n  }, {\n    text: 'How are you'\n  }])\n  .then(messages => console.log(messages));\n\nPOST /messages\n{\n  \"text\": \"A test message\"\n}\nadapter.update(id, data, params) -> Promise\nCompletely replaces a single record identified by id with data. Does not allow replacing multiple records (id can't be null). id can not be changed.\napp.service('messages').update(1, {\n    text: 'Updates message'\n  })\n  .then(message => console.log(message));\n\nPUT /messages/1\n{ \"text\": \"Updated message\" }\nadapter.patch(id, data, params) -> Promise\nMerges a record identified by id with data. id can be null to allow replacing multiple records (all records that match params.query the same as in .find). id can not be changed.\napp.service('messages').update(1, {\n    text: 'A patched message'\n  })\n  .then(message => console.log(message));\n\nconst params = {\n  query: { read: false }\n};\n\n// Mark all unread messages as read\napp.service('messages').patch(null, {\n  read: true\n}, params);\n\nPATCH /messages/1\n{ \"text\": \"A patched message\" }\nMark all unread messages as read\nPATCH /messages?read=false\n{ \"read\": true }\nadapter.remove(id, params) -> Promise\nRemoves a record identified by id. id can be null to allow removing multiple records (all records that match params.query the same as in .find).\napp.service('messages').remove(1)\n  .then(message => console.log(message));\n\nconst params = {\n  query: { read: true }\n};\n\n// Remove all read messages\napp.service('messages').remove(null, params);\n\nDELETE /messages/1\nRemove all read messages\nDELETE /messages?read=true\nExtending Adapters\nThere are two ways to extend existing database adapters. Either by extending the ES6 base class or by adding functionality through hooks.\n\nProTip: Keep in mind that calling the original service methods will return a Promise that resolves with the value.\n\nHooks\nThe most flexible option is weaving in functionality through hooks. For example, createdAt and updatedAt timestamps could be added like this:\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst hooks = require('feathers-hooks');\n\n// Import the database adapter of choice\nconst service = require('feathers-');\n\nconst app = feathers()\n  .configure(hooks())\n  .use('/todos', service({\n    paginate: {\n      default: 2,\n      max: 4\n    }\n  }));\n\napp.service('todos').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      (hook) => hook.data.createdAt = new Date()\n    ],\n\n    update: [\n      (hook) => hook.data.updatedAt = new Date()\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3030);\n\nClasses (ES6)\nAll modules also export an ES6 class as Service that can be directly extended like this:\n'use strict';\n\nconst Service = require( 'feathers-').Service;\n\nclass MyService extends Service {\n  create(data, params) {\n    data.created_at = new Date();\n\n    return super.create(data, params);\n  }\n\n  update(id, data, params) {\n    data.updated_at = new Date();\n\n    return super.update(id, data, params);\n  }\n}\n\napp.use('/todos', new MyService({\n  paginate: {\n    default: 2,\n    max: 4\n  }\n}));\n\n"},"api/databases/querying.html":{"url":"api/databases/querying.html","title":"Querying","keywords":"","body":"Querying\nAll official database adapters support a common way for querying, sorting, limiting and selecting find method calls as part of params.query.

Depending on the service the values in params.query might have to be converted to the right type in a before hook.\n\nEquality\nAll fields that do not contain special query parameters are compared directly for equality.\n// Find all unread messages in room #2\napp.service('messages').find({\n  query: {\n    read: false,\n    roomId: 2\n  }\n});\n\nGET /messages?read=false&roomId=2\n$limit\n$limit will return only the number of results you specify:\n// Retrieves the first two unread messages\napp.service('messages').find({\n  query: {\n    $limit: 2,\n    read: false\n  }\n});\n\nGET /messages?$limit=2&read=false\n\nPro tip: With pagination enabled, to just get the number of available records set $limit to 0.

Collation parameters may be passed using the special collation parameter to the find(), remove() and patch() methods.\nExample: Patch records with case-insensitive alphabetical ordering.\nThe example below would patch all student records with grades of 'c' or 'C' and above (a natural language ordering). Without collations this would not be as simple, since the comparison { $gt: 'c' } would not include uppercase grades of 'C' because the code point of 'C' is less than that of 'c'.\nconst patch = { shouldStudyMore: true };\nconst query = { grade: { $gte: 'c' } };\nconst collation = { locale: 'en', strength: 1 };\nstudents.patch(null, patch, { query, collation }).then( ... );\n\nExample: Find records with a case-insensitive search.\nSimilar to the above example, this would find students with a grade of 'c' or greater, in a case-insensitive manner.\nconst query = { grade: { $gte: 'c' } };\nconst collation = { locale: 'en', strength: 1 };\nstudents.find({ query, collation }).then( ... );\n\nFor more information on MongoDB's collation feature, visit the collation reference page.\n"},"api/databases/mongoose.html":{"url":"api/databases/mongoose.html","title":"Mongoose","keywords":"","body":"Mongoose\n\n\n\nfeathers-mongoose is a database adapter for Mongoose, an object modeling tool for MongoDB.\n$ npm install --save mongoose feathers-mongoose\n\n\nImportant: To use this adapter you also want to be familiar with the database adapter common API and querying mechanism.\nThis adapter also requires a running MongoDB database server.\n\nAPI\nservice(options)\nReturns a new service instance initialized with the given options.

Normally, this will be set in a before hook:\napp.service('messages').hooks({\n  before: {\n    patch(hook) {\n      // Set some additional Mongoose options\n      // The adapter tries to use sane defaults\n      // but they can always be changed here\n      hook.params.mongoose = {\n        runValidators: true,\n        setDefaultsOnInsert: true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nExample\nHere's a complete example of a Feathers server with a messages Mongoose service.\n$ npm install feathers feathers-errors feathers-rest body-parser mongoose feathers-mongoose\nIn message-model.js:\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst Schema = mongoose.Schema;\nconst MessageSchema = new Schema({\n  text: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  }\n});\nconst Model = mongoose.model('Message', MessageSchema);\n\nmodule.exports = Model;\n\nThen in app.js:\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst errorHandler = require('feathers-errors/handler');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst service = require('feathers-mongoose');\n\nconst Model = require('./message-model');\n\n// Tell mongoose to use native promises\n// See http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html\nmongoose.Promise = global.Promise;\n\n// Connect to your MongoDB instance(s)\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/feathers');\n\n// Create a feathers instance.\nconst app = feathers()\n  // Enable REST services\n  .configure(rest())\n  // Turn on JSON parser for REST services\n  .use(bodyParser.json())\n  // Turn on URL-encoded parser for REST services\n  .use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))\n  // Connect to the db, create and register a Feathers service.\n  .use('/messages', service({\n    Model,\n    lean: true, // set to false if you want Mongoose documents returned\n    paginate: {\n      default: 2,\n      max: 4\n    }\n  }))\n  .use(errorHandler());\n\n// Create a dummy Message\napp.service('messages').create({\n  text: 'Message created on server'\n}).then(function(message) {\n  console.log('Created message', message);\n});\n\n// Start the server.\nconst port = 3030;\napp.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Feathers server listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n\nYou can run this example by using node app and go to localhost:3030/messages.\nQuerying, Validation\nMongoose by default gives you the ability to add validations at the model level. Using an error handler like the one that comes with Feathers your validation errors will be formatted nicely right out of the box!\nFor more information on querying and validation refer to the Mongoose documentation.\n$populate\nFor Mongoose, the special $populate query parameter can be used to allow Mongoose query population.\napp.service('posts').find({\n  query: { $populate: 'user' }\n});\n\nDiscriminators (Inheritance)\nInstead of strict inheritance, Mongoose uses discriminators as their schema inheritance model.\nTo use them, pass in a discriminatorKey option to your schema object and use Model.discriminator('modelName', schema) instead of mongoose.model()\nFeathers comes with full support for mongoose discriminators, allowing for automatic fetching of inherited types. A typical use case might look like:\nvar mongoose = require('mongoose');\nvar Schema = mongoose.Schema;\nvar Post = require('./post');\nvar feathers = require('feathers');\nvar app = feathers();\nvar service = require('feathers-mongoose');\n\n// Discriminator key, we'll use this later to refer to all text posts\nvar options = {\n  discriminatorKey: '_type'\n};\n\nvar TextPostSchema = new Schema({\n  text: { type: String, default: null }\n}, options);\n\nTextPostSchema.index({'updatedAt': -1, background: true});\n\n// Note the use of `Post.discriminator` rather than `mongoose.discriminator`.\nvar TextPost = Post.discriminator('text', TextPostSchema);\n\n// Using the discriminators option, let feathers know about any inherited models you may have\n// for that service\napp.use('/posts', service({\n  Model: Post,\n  discriminators: [TextPost]\n}))\n\nWithout support for discriminators, when you perform a .get on the posts service, you'd only get back Post models, not TextPost models.\nNow in your query, you can specify a value for your discriminatorKey:\n{\n  _type: 'text'\n}\nand Feathers will automatically swap in the correct model and execute the query it instead of its parent model.\n"},"api/databases/sequelize.html":{"url":"api/databases/sequelize.html","title":"Sequelize","keywords":"","body":"Sequelize\n\n\n\nfeathers-sequelize is a database adapter for Sequelize, an ORM for Node.js.

However, there are times when you will want to take advantage of Sequelize Instance methods. There are two ways to tell feathers to return Sequelize instances:\n\nSet { raw: false } in a \"before\" hook: function rawFalse(hook) {\n     if (!hook.params.sequelize) hook.params.sequelize = {};\n     Object.assign(hook.params.sequelize, { raw: false });\n     return hook;\n }\n hooks.before.find = [rawFalse];\n\n\nUse the new hydrate hook in the \"after\" phase:\n const hydrate = require('feathers-sequelize/hooks/hydrate');\n hooks.after.find = [hydrate()];\n\n // Or, if you need to include associated models, you can do the following:\n  function includeAssociated (hook) {\n      return hydrate({\n         include: [{ model: hook.app.services.fooservice.Model }]\n      }).call(this, hook);\n  }\n  hooks.after.find = [includeAssociated];\n\nFor a more complete example see this gist.\n\n\n\nImportant: When working with Sequelize Instances, most of the feathers-hooks-common will no longer work. If you need to use a common hook or other 3rd party hooks, you should use the \"dehydrate\" hook to convert data back to a plain object:\nconst hydrate = require('feathers-sequelize/hooks/hydrate');\nconst dehydrate = require('feathers-sequelize/hooks/dehydrate');\nconst { populate } = require('feathers-hooks-common');\n\nhooks.after.find = [hydrate(), doSomethingCustom(), dehydrate(), populate()];\n\n\nValidation\nSequelize by default gives you the ability to add validations at the model level. Using an error handler like the one that comes with Feathers your validation errors will be formatted nicely right out of the box!\nMigrations\nMigrations with feathers and sequelize are quite simple and we have provided some sample code to get you started. This guide will follow the directory structure used by the sample code, but you are free to rearrange things as you see fit. The following assumes you have a migrations folder in the root of your app.\nInitial Setup: one-time tasks\n\nInstall the sequelize CLI:\n\nnpm install sequelize-cli --save -g\n\nCreate a .sequelizerc file in your project root with the following content:\n\nconst path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  'config': path.resolve('migrations/config/config.js'),\n  'migrations-path': path.resolve('migrations'),\n  'seeders-path': path.resolve('migrations/seeders'),\n  'models-path': path.resolve('migrations/models')\n};\n\n\nCreate the migrations config in migrations/config/config.js:\n\nconst app = require('../../src/app');\nconst env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  [env]: {\n    url: app.get('db_url'),\n    dialect: app.get('db_dialect'),\n    migrationStorageTableName: '_migrations'\n  }\n};\n\n\nRegister your models. The following assumes you have defined your models using the method described here.\n\nconst Sequelize = require('sequelize');\nconst app = require('../../src/app');\nconst models = app.get('models');\nconst sequelize = app.get('sequelize');\n\n// The export object must be a dictionary of model names -> models\n// It must also include sequelize (instance) and Sequelize (constructor) properties\nmodule.exports = Object.assign({\n  Sequelize,\n  sequelize\n}, models);\n\n\nMigrations workflow\nThe migration commands will load your application and it is therefore required that you define the same environment variables as when running you application. For example, many applications will define the database connection string in the startup command:\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname npm start\nAll of the following commands assume that you have defined the same environment variables used by your application.\n\nProTip: To save typing, you can export environment variables for your current bash/terminal session:\nexport DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/db\n\nCreate a new migration\nTo create a new migration file, run the following command and provide a meaningful name:\nsequelize migration:create --name=\"meaningful-name\"\nThis will create a new file in the migrations folder. All migration file names will be prefixed with a sortable data/time string: 20160421135254-meaninful-name.js. This prefix is crucial for making sure your migrations are executed in the proper order.\n\nNOTE: The order of your migrations is determined by the alphabetical order of the migration scripts in the file system. The file names generated by the CLI tools will always ensure that the most recent migration comes last. \n\nAdd the up/down scripts:\nOpen the newly created migration file and write the code to both apply and undo the migration. Please refer to the sequelize migration functions for available operations. Do not be lazy - write the down script too and test! Here is an example of converting a NOT NULL column accept null values:\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  up: function (queryInterface, Sequelize) {\n    return queryInterface.changeColumn('tableName', 'columnName', {\n      type: Sequelize.STRING,\n      allowNull: true\n    });\n  },\n\n  down: function (queryInterface, Sequelize) {\n    return queryInterface.changeColumn('tableName', 'columnName', {\n      type: Sequelize.STRING,\n      allowNull: false\n    });\n  }\n};\n\n\nProTip: As of this writing, if you use the changeColumn method you must always specify the type, even if the type is not changing.\nProTip: Down scripts are typically easy to create and should be nearly identical to the up script except with inverted logic and inverse method calls.\n\nKeeping your app code in sync with migrations\nThe application code should always be up to date with the migrations. This allows the app to be freshly installed with everything up-to-date without running the migration scripts. Your migrations should also never break a freshly installed app. This often times requires that you perform any necessary checks before executing a task. For example, if you update a model to include a new field, your migration should first check to make sure that new field does not exist:\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  up: function (queryInterface, Sequelize) {\n    return queryInterface.describeTable('tableName').then(attributes => {\n      if ( !attributes.columnName ) {\n        return queryInterface.addColumn('tableName', 'columnName', {\n          type: Sequelize.INTEGER,\n          defaultValue: 0\n        });\n      }\n    })\n  },\n\n  down: function (queryInterface, Sequelize) {\n    return queryInterface.describeTable('tableName').then(attributes => {\n      if ( attributes.columnName ) {\n        return queryInterface.removeColumn('tableName', 'columnName');\n      }\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nApply a migration\nThe CLI tools will always run your migrations in the correct order and will keep track of which migrations have been applied and which have not. This data is stored in the database under the _migrations table. To ensure you are up to date, simply run the following:\nsequelize db:migrate\n\nProTip: You can add the migrations script to your application startup command to ensure that all migrations have run every time your app is started. Try updating your package.json scripts attribute and run npm start:\nscripts: {\n    start: \"sequelize db:migrate && node src/\"\n}\n\nUndo the previous migration\nTo undo the last migration, run the following command:\nsequelize db:migrate:undo\nContinue running the command to undo each migration one at a time - the migrations will be undone in the proper order.\n\nNote: - You shouldn't really have to undo a migration unless you are the one developing a new migration and you want to test that it works. Applications rarely have to revert to a previous state, but when they do you will be glad you took the time to write and test your down scripts!\n\nReverting your app to a previous state\nIn the unfortunate case where you must revert your app to a previous state, it is important to take your time and plan your method of attack. Every application is different and there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for rewinding an application. However, most applications should be able to follow these steps (order is important):\n\nStop your application (kill the process)\nFind the last stable version of your app\nCount the number of migrations which have been added since that version\nUndo your migrations one at a time until the db is in the correct state\nRevert your code back to the previous state \nStart your app\n\n"},"api/databases/knexjs.html":{"url":"api/databases/knexjs.html","title":"Knex","keywords":"","body":"KnexJS\n\n\n\nfeathers-knex is a database adapter for KnexJS, an SQL query builder for Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, and Oracle.\nnpm install --save mysql knex feathers-knex\n\n\nImportant: To use this adapter you also want to be familiar with the database adapter common API and querying mechanism.\nNote: You also need to install the database driver for the DB you want to use.\n\nAPI\nservice(options)\nReturns a new service instance initialized with the given options.\nconst knex = require('knex');\nconst service = require('feathers-knex');\n\nconst db = knex({\n  client: 'sqlite3',\n  connection: {\n    filename: './db.sqlite'\n  }\n});\n\n// Create the schema\ndb.schema.createTable('messages', table => {\n  table.increments('id');\n  table.string('text');\n});\n\napp.use('/messages', service({\n  Model: db,\n  name: 'messages'\n}));\napp.use('/messages', service({ Model, name, id, events, paginate }));\n\nOptions:\n\nModel (required) - The KnexJS database instance\nname (required) - The name of the table\nid (optional, default: 'id') - The name of the id field property.\nevents (optional) - A list of custom service events sent by this service\npaginate (optional) - A pagination object containing a default and max page size\n\nadapter.createQuery(query)\nReturns a KnexJS query with the common filter criteria (without pagination) applied.\nparams.knex\nWhen making a service method call, params can contain an knex property which allows to modify the options used to run the KnexJS query.

This adapter is not using any ORM, it is dealing with the database directly through the elasticsearch.js Client.\n$ npm install --save elasticsearch feathers-elasticsearch\n\nGetting Started\nThe following bare-bones example will create a messages endpoint and connect to a local messages type in the test index in your Elasticsearch database:\nconst elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');\nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst service = require('feathers-elasticsearch');\n\napp.use('/messages', service({\n  Model: new elasticsearch.Client({\n    host: 'localhost:9200',\n    apiVersion: '5.0'\n  }),\n  elasticsearch: {\n    index: 'test',\n    type: 'messages'\n  }\n}));\n\nOptions\nThe following options can be passed when creating a new Elasticsearch service:\n\nModel (required) - The Elasticsearch client instance.\nelasticsearch (required) - Configuration object for elasticsearch requests. The required properties are index and type. Apart from that you can specify anything that can be passed to all requests going to Elasticsearch. Another recognised property is refresh which is set to false by default. Anything else use at your own risk.\nid (default: '_id') [optional] - The id property of your documents in this service.\nmeta (default: '_meta') [optional] - The meta property of your documents in this service. The meta field is an object containing elasticsearch specific information, e.g. _score, _type, _index, and so forth.\npaginate [optional] - A pagination object containing a default and max page size (see the Pagination chapter).\n\nComplete Example\nHere's an example of a Feathers server that uses feathers-elasticsearch. \nconst feathers = require('feathers');\nconst rest = require('feathers-rest');\nconst hooks = require('feathers-hooks');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst errorHandler = require('feathers-errors/handler');\nconst service = require('feathers-elasticsearch');\nconst elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');\n\nconst messageService = service({\n  Model: new elasticsearch.Client({\n    host: 'localhost:9200',\n    apiVersion: '5.0'\n  }),\n  paginate: {\n    default: 10,\n    max: 50\n  },\n  elasticsearch: {\n    index: 'test',\n    type: 'messages'\n  }\n});\n\n// Initialize the application\nconst app = feathers()\n  .configure(rest())\n  .configure(hooks())\n  // Needed for parsing bodies (login)\n  .use(bodyParser.json())\n  .use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))\n  // Initialize your feathers plugin\n  .use('/messages', messageService)\n  .use(errorHandler());\n\napp.listen(3030);\n\nconsole.log('Feathers app started on 127.0.0.1:3030');\n\nYou can run this example by using npm start and going to localhost:3030/messages.\nYou should see an empty array. That's because you don't have any messages yet but you now have full CRUD for your new message service!\nSupported Elasticsearch specific queries\nOn top of the standard, cross-adapter queries, feathers-elasticsearch also supports Elasticsearch specific queries.\n$all\nThe simplest query match_all. Find all documents.\nquery: {\n  $all: true\n}\n\n$prefix\nTerm level query prefix. Find all documents which have given field containing terms with a specified prefix (not analyzed).\nquery: {\n  user: {\n    $prefix: 'bo'\n  }\n}\n\n$match\nFull text query match. Find all documents which have given given fields matching the specified value (analysed).\nquery: {\n  bio: {\n    $match: 'javascript'\n  }\n}\n\n$phrase\nFull text query match_phrase. Find all documents which have given given fields matching the specified phrase (analysed).\nquery: {\n  bio: {\n    $phrase: 'I like JavaScript'\n  }\n}\n\n$phrase_prefix\nFull text query match_phrase_prefix. Find all documents which have given given fields matching the specified phrase prefix (analysed).\nquery: {\n  bio: {\n    $phrase_prefix: 'I like JavaS'\n  }\n}\n\n$child\nJoining query has_child.\nFind all documents which have children matching the query. The $child query is essentially a full-blown query of its own. The $child query requires $type property.\nquery: {\n  $child: {\n    $type: 'blog_tag',\n    tag: 'something'\n  }\n}\n\n$parent\nJoining query has_parent.\nFind all documents which have parent matching the query. The $parent query is essentially a full-blown query of its own. The $parent query requires $type property.\nquery: {\n  $parent: {\n    $type: 'blog',\n    title: {\n      $match: 'javascript'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n$and\nThis operator does not translate directly to any Elasticsearch query, but it provides support for Elasticsearch array datatype.\nFind all documents which match all of the given criteria. As any field in Elasticsearch can contain an array, therefore sometimes it is important to match more than one value per field.\nquery: {\n  $and: [\n    { notes: { $match: 'javascript' } },\n    { notes: { $match: 'project' } }\n  ]\n}\n\nThere is also a shorthand version of $and for equality. For instance:\nquery: {\n  $and: [\n    { tags: 'javascript' },\n    { tags: 'react' }\n  ]\n}\n\nCan be also expressed as:\nquery: {\n  tags: ['javascript', 'react']\n}\n\n$sqs\nsimple_query_string. A query that uses the SimpleQueryParser to parse its context. Optional $operator which is set to or by default but can be set to and if required.\nquery: {\n  $sqs: {\n    $fields: [\n      'title^5',\n      'description'\n    ],\n    $query: '+like +javascript',\n    $operator: 'and'\n  }\n}\n\nThis can also be expressed in an URL as the following:\nhttp://localhost:3030/users?$sqs[$fields][]=title^5&$sqs[$fields][]=description&$sqs[$query]=+like +javascript&$sqs[$operator]=and\n\nParent-child relationship\nElasticsearch supports parent-child relationship, however it is not exactly the same as in relational databases. feathers-elasticsearch supports all CRUD operations for Elasticsearch types with parent mapping, and does that with the Elasticsearch constrains. Therefore:\n\neach operation concering a single document (create, get, patch, update, remove) is required to provide parent id\ncreating documents in bulk (providing a list of documents) is the same as many single document operations, so parent id is required as well\nto avoid any doubts, each query based operation (find, bulk patch, bulk remove) cannot have the parent id\n\nHow to specify parent id\nParent id should be provided as part of the data for the create operations (single and bulk):\nparentService.create({\n  _id: 123,\n  title: 'JavaScript: The Good Parts'\n});\n\nchildService.create({\n  _id: 1000\n  tag: 'javascript',\n  _parent: 123\n})\n\nPlease note, that name of the parent property (_parent by default) is configurable through the service options, so that you can set it to whatever suits you.\nFor all other operations (get, patch, update, remove), the parent id should be provided as part of the query:\nchildService.remove(\n  1000,\n  { query: { _parent: 123 } }\n);\n\nSupported Elasticsearch versions\nfeathers-elasticsearch is currently tested on Elasticsearch 2.4, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. Please note, event though the lowest version supported is 2.4,\nthat does not mean it wouldn't work fine on anything lower than 2.4.\nQuirks\nUpdating and deleting by query\nElasticsearch is special in many ways. For example, the \"update by query\" API is still considered experimental and so is the \"delete by query\" API introduced in Elasticsearch 5.0.\nJust to clarify - update in Elasticsearch is an equivalent to patch in feathers. I will use patch from now on, to set focus on the feathers side of the fence.\nConsidering the above, our implementation of path / remove by query uses combo of find and bulk patch / remove, which in turn means for you:\n\nStandard pagination is taken into account for patching / removing by query, so you have no guarantee that all existing documents matching your query will be patched / removed.\nThe operation is a bit slower than it could potentially be, because of the two-step process involved.\n\nConsidering, however that elasticsearch is mainly used to dump data in it and search through it, I presume that should not be a great problem.\nSearch visibility\nPlease be aware that search visibility of the changes (creates, updates, patches, removals) is going to be delayed due to Elasticsearch index.refresh_interval setting. You may force refresh after each operation by setting the service option elasticsearch.refresh as decribed above but it is highly discouraged due to Elasticsearch performance implications.\nFull-text search\nCurrently feathers-elasticsearch supports most important full-text queries in their default form. Elasticsearch search allows additional parameters to be passed to each of those queries for fine-tuning. Those parameters can change behaviour and affect peformance of the queries therefore I believe they should not be exposed to the client. I am considering ways of adding them safely to the queries while retaining flexibility.\nPerformance considerations\nNone of the data mutating operations in Elasticsearch v2.4 (create, update, patch, remove) returns the full resulting document, therefore I had to resolve to using get as well in order to return complete data. This solution is of course adding a bit of an overhead, although it is also compliant with the standard behaviour expected of a feathers database adapter.\nThe conceptual solution for that is quite simple. This behaviour will be configurable through a lean switch allowing to get rid of those additional gets should they be not needed for your application. This feature will be added soon as well.\n"},"SECURITY.html":{"url":"SECURITY.html","title":"Security","keywords":"","body":"Feathers Security\nWe take security very seriously at Feathers. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code to ensure nobody's Feathers app is ever compromised or hacked. As a web application developer you are responsible for any security breaches. We do our very best to make sure Feathers is as secure as possible.\nWhere should I report security issues?\nIn order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues to us. Send us a PM in Slack or email us at hello@feathersjs.com with details and we will respond ASAP. Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work so we'll work with you to come up with a resolution and plan and document the issue on Github in the appropriate repo.\nIssuing releases is typically very quick. Once an issue is resolved it is usually released immediately with the appropriate semantic version.\nSecurity Considerations\nHere are some things that you should be aware of when writing your app to make sure it is secure.\n\nEscape any HTML and JavaScript to avoid XSS attacks.\nEscape any SQL (typically done by the SQL library) to avoid SQL injection.\nEvents are sent by default to any client listening for that event. Lock down any private events that should not be broadcast by adding filters. Feathers authentication does this for all auth services by default.\nJSON Web Tokens (JWT's) are only signed, they are not encrypted. Therefore, the payload can be examined on the client. This is by design. DO NOT put anything that should be private in the JWT payload unless you encrypt it first.\nDon't use a weak secret for you token service. The generator creates a strong one for you automatically. No need to change it.\nUse hooks to check security roles to make sure users can only access data they should be permitted to. We've provided some built in authorization hooks to make this process easier (many of which are added by default to a generated app).\n\nSome of the technologies we employ\n\nPassword storage inside feathers-authentication uses bcrypt. We don't store the salts separately since they are included in the bcrypt hashes.\nJWT is used instead of cookies to avoid CSRF attacks. We use the HS512 algorithm by default (HMAC using SHA-512 hash algorithm).\nWe run nsp as part of our CI. This notifies us if we are susceptible to any vulernabilites that have been reported to the Node Security Project.\n\nXSS Attacks\nAs with any web application you need to guard against XSS attacks. Since Feathers persists the JWT in localstorage in the browser, if your app falls victim to a XSS attack your JWT could be used by an attacker to make malicious requests on your behalf. This is far from ideal. Therefore you need to take extra care in preventing XSS attacks. Our stance on this particular attack vector is that if you are susceptible to XSS attacks then a compromised JWT is the least of your worries because keystrokes could be logged and attackers can just steal passwords, credit card numbers, directly etc.\nFor more information see:\n\nthis issue\nand this Auth0 forum thread.\n\n"},"ecosystem/readme.html":{"url":"ecosystem/readme.html","title":"Ecosystem","keywords":"","body":"Feathers Ecosystem\nBelow are some of the amazing things built with Feathers or for the Feathers ecosystem.\nWe also have a very helpful community in Slack.\n\nProduction Applications\n\nBeachfrontDigital\nContactImpact\nEquibit Group\nFoxflow\nGenerousTickets\nGratify\nHeadstart\nHaulHound\nJ.A.B.

We'll either be updating the guide directly, providing answers here, or both.\nHow do I create custom methods?\nOne important thing to know about Feathers is that it only exposes the official service methods to clients. While you can add and use any service method on the server, it is not possible to expose those custom methods to clients.\nIn the Why Feathers chapter we discussed how the uniform interface of services naturally translates into a REST API and also makes it easy to hook into the execution of known methods and emit events when they return. Adding support for custom methods would add a new level of complexity defining how to describe, expose and secure custom methods. This does not go well with Feathers approach of adding services as a small and well defined concept.\nIn general, almost anything that may require custom methods can also be done either by creating a custom service or through hooks. For example, a userService.resetPassword method can also be implemented as a password service that resets the password in the create method:\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\n\nclass PasswordService {\n  create(data) {\n    const userId = data.user_id;\n    const userService = this.app.service('user');\n\n    return userService.patch(userId, {\n      passwordToken: crypto.randomBytes(48)\n    }).then(user => sendEmail(user))\n  }\n\n  setup(app) {\n    this.app = app;\n  }\n}\n\nFor more examples also see this issue comment.\nHow do I do nested or custom routes?\nNormally we find that they actually aren't needed and that it is much better to keep your routes as flat as possible. For example something like users/:userId/posts is - although nice to read for humans - actually not as easy to parse and process as the equivalent /posts?userId= that is already supported by Feathers out of the box. Additionaly, this will also work much better when using Feathers through websocket connections which do not have a concept of routes at all.\nHowever, nested routes for services can still be created by registering an existing service on the nested route and mapping the route parameter to a query parameter like this:\napp.use('/posts', postService);\napp.use('/users', userService);\n\n// re-export the posts service on the /users/:userId/posts route\napp.use('/users/:userId/posts', app.service('posts'));\n\n// A hook that updates `data` with the route parameter\nfunction mapUserIdToData(hook) {\n  if(hook.data && hook.params.userId) {\n    hook.data.userId = hook.params.userId;\n  }\n}\n\n// For the new route, map the `:userId` route parameter to the query in a hook\napp.service('users/:userId/posts').hooks({\n  before: {\n    find(hook) {\n      hook.params.query.userId = hook.params.userId;\n    },\n    create: mapUserIdToData,\n    update: mapUserIdToData,\n    patch: mapUserIdToData\n  }  \n})\n\nNow going to /users/123/posts will call postService.find({ query: { userId: 123 } }) and return all posts for that user.\nFor more information about URL routing and parameters, refer to the Express chapter.\n\nNote: URLs should never contain actions that change data (like post/publish or post/delete). This has always been an important part of the HTTP protocol and Feathers enforces this more strictly than most other frameworks. For example to publish a post you would call .patch(id, { published: true }).\n\nHow do I do search?\nThis depends on the database adapter you are using. Many databases already support their own search syntax:\n\nRegular expressions (converted in a a hook) for Mongoose, MongoDB and NeDB, see this comment\n$like for Sequelize which can be set in params.sequelize\nSome database adapters like KnexJS, RethinkDB and Elasticsearch also support non-standard query parameters which are described in their documentation pages.\n\nFor further discussions see this issue.\nWhy am I not getting JSON errors?\nIf you get a plain text error and a 500 status code for errors that should return different status codes, make sure you have the feathers-errors/handler configured as described in the Express errors chapter.\nWhy am I not getting the correct HTTP error code\nSee the above answer.\nHow can I do custom methods like findOrCreate?\nCustom functionality can almost always be mapped to an existing service method using hooks.  For example, findOrCreate can be implemented as a before-hook on the service's get method.  See this gist for an example of how to implement this in a before-hook.\nHow do I render templates?\nFeathers works just like Express so it's the exact same. We've created a helpful little guide right here.\nHow do I create channels or rooms\nAlthough Socket.io has a concept of rooms and you can always fall back to it other websocket libraries that Feathers supports do not. The Feathers way of letting a user listen to e.g. messages on a room is through event filtering. There are two ways:\n\nUpdate the user object with the rooms they are subscribed to and filter based on those\n\n// On the client\nfunction joinRoom(roomId) {\n  const user = app.get('user');\n\n  return app.service('users').patch(user.id, { rooms: user.rooms.concat(roomId) });\n}\n\n// On the server\napp.service('messages').filter(function(message, connection) {\n  return connection.user.rooms.indexOf(message.room_id) !== -1;\n});\nThe advantage of this method is that you can show offline/online users that are subscribed to a room.\n\nCreate a custom join event with a room id and then filter based on it\n\napp.use(socketio(function(io) {\n  io.on('connection', function(socket) {\n    socket.on('join', function(roomId) {\n      socket.feathers.rooms.push(roomId);\n    });\n  });\n}));\n\napp.service('messages').filter(function(message, connection) {\n  return connection.rooms.indexOf(message.room_id) !== -1;\n});\n\nThe room assignment will persist only for the duration of the socket connection.\nHow do I do validation?\nIf your database/ORM supports a model or schema (ie. Mongoose or Sequelize) then you have 2 options.\nThe preferred way\nYou perform validation at the service level using hooks. This is better because it keeps your app database agnostic so you can easily swap databases without having to change your validations much.\nIf you write a bunch of small hooks that validate specific things it is easier to test and also slightly more performant because you can exit out of the validation chain early instead of having to go all the way to the point of inserting data into the database to find out if that data is invalid.\nIf you don't have a model or schema then validating with hooks is currently your only option. If you come up with something different feel free to submit a PR!\nThe ORM way\nWith ORM adapters you can perform validation at the model level:\n\nUsing Mongoose\nUsing Sequelize\n\nThe nice thing about the model level validations is Feathers will return the validation errors to the client in a nice consistent format for you.\nHow do I do associations?\nSimilar to validation, it depends on if your database/ORM supports models or not.\nThe preferred way\nFor any of the feathers database/ORM adapters you can just use hooks to fetch data from other services.\nThis is a better approach because it keeps your application database agnostic and service oriented. By referencing the services (using app.service().find(), etc.) you can still decouple your app and have these services live on entirely separate machines or use entirely different databases without having to change any of your fetching code.\nThis has been implemented in the populate common hook.\nThe ORM way\nWith mongoose you can use the $populate query param to populate nested documents.\n// Find Hulk Hogan and include all the messages he sent\napp.service('user').find({\n  query: {\n    name: 'hulk@hogan.net',\n    $populate: ['sentMessages']\n  }\n});\n\nWith Sequelize you can do this:\n// Find Hulk Hogan and include all the messages he sent\napp.service('user').find({\n  name: 'hulk@hogan.net',\n  sequelize: {\n    include: [{\n      model: Message,\n      where: { sender: Sequelize.col('user.id') }\n    }]\n  }\n});\n\nOr set it in a hook as described here.\nSequelize models and associations\nIf you are using the Sequelize adapter, understanding SQL and Sequelize first is very important. For further information see this documentation chapter and this answer on Stackoverflow.\nWhat about Koa/Hapi/X?\nThere are many other Node server frameworks out there like Koa, a \"next generation web framework for Node.JS\" using ES6 generator functions instead of Express middleware or HapiJS etc. Because Feathers 2 is already universally usable we are planning the ability for it to hook into other frameworks on the server as well. More information can be found in this issue.\nHow do I filter emitted service events?\nSee this section.\nHow do I access the request object in hooks or services?\nIn short, you shouldn't need to. If you look at the hooks chapter you'll see all the params that are available on a hook.\nIf you still need something from the request object (for example, the requesting IP address) you can simply tack it on to the req.feathers object as described here.\nHow do I mount sub apps?\nIt's pretty much exactly the same as Express. More information can be found here.\nHow do I do some processing after sending the response to the user?\nThe hooks workflow allows you to handle these situations quite gracefully.  It depends on the promise that you return in your hook. Here's an example of a hook that sends an email, but doesn't wait for a success message.\nfunction (hook) {\n\n  // Send an email by calling to the email service.\n  hook.app.service('emails').create({\n    to: 'user@email.com',\n    body: 'You are so great!'\n  });\n\n  // Send a message to some logging service.\n  hook.app.service('logging').create(hook.data);\n\n  // Return a resolved promise to immediately move to the next hook\n  // and not wait for the two previous promises to resolve.\n  return Promise.resolve(hook);\n}\n\nHow do I debug my app\nIt's really no different than debugging any other NodeJS app but you can refer to the Debugging section of the guide for more Feathers specific tips and tricks.\npossible EventEmitter memory leak detected warning\nThis warning is not as bad as it sounds. If you got it from Feathers you most likely registered more than 64 services and/or event listeners on a Socket. If you don't think there are that many services or event listeners you may have a memory leak. Otherwise you can increase the number in the Socket.io configuration via io.sockets.setMaxListeners(number) and with Primus via primus.setMaxListeners(number). number can be 0 for unlimited listeners or any other number of how many listeners you'd expect in the worst case.\nWhy can't I pass params from the client?\nWhen you make a call like:\nconst params = { foo: 'bar' };\nclient.service('users').patch(1, { admin: true }, params).then(result => {\n  // handle response\n});\n\non the client the hook.params object will only be available in your client side hooks. It will not be provided to the server. The reason for this is because hook.params on the server usually contains information that should be server-side only. This can be database options, whether a request is authenticated, etc. If we passed those directly from the client to the server this would be a big security risk. Only the client side hook.params.query and hook.params.headers objects are provided to the server.\nIf you need to pass info from the client to the server that is not part of the query you need to add it to hook.params.query on the client side and explicitly pull it out of hook.params.query on the server side. This can be achieved like so:\n// client side\nclient.hooks({\n  before: {\n    all: [\n      hook => {\n        hook.params.query.$client = {\n          platform: 'ios',\n          version: '1.0'\n        };\n\n        return hook;\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\n// server side, inside app.hooks.js\nconst hooks = require('feathers-hooks-common');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  before: {\n    all: [\n      // remove values from hook.params.query.$client and move them to hook.params\n      // so hook.params.query.$client.version -> hook.params.version\n      // and hook.params.query.$client is removed.\n      hooks.client('version', 'platform')\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nHow do I set up HTTPS?\nCheck out the Feathers Express HTTPS docs.\nIs Feathers production ready?\nYes! It's being used in production by a bunch of companies from startups to fortune 500s.

If you see something that you can contribute, we would LOVE a pull request with your edits! To make this easy you can click the \"Edit this page\" link at the top of the web docs.\nThe docs are all written in GitHub Flavored Markdown.  If you've used GitHub, it's pretty likely you've encountered it before.  You can become a pro in a few minutes by reading their GFM Documentation page.\nOrganizing Files\nYou'll notice that the GitHub Repo is organized in a nice logical folder structure.  The first file in each chapter is named as a description of the entire chapter's topic.  For example, the content related to databases is located in api/databases/. \nSome of the chapters are split into multiple sections to help break up the content and make it easier to digest. You can easily see how chapters are laid out by looking at the SUMMARY.md file. This convention helps keep chapters together in the file system and easy to view either directly on github or gitbook.\nTable of Contents\nYou'll find the table of contents in the SUMMARY.md file.  It's a nested list of markdown links.  You can link to a file simply by putting the filename (including the extension) inside the link target.\nIntroduction Page\nThis is the root README.md file. It's intent is to give the reader an elevator pitch of what Feathers is and why we think it is useful.\nSend a Pull Request\nSo that's it. You make your edits, keep your files and the Table of Contents organized, and send us a pull request.\nEnjoy the Offline Docs\nMoments after your edits are merged, they will be automatically published to the web, as a downloadable PDF, .mobi file (Kindle compatible), and ePub file (iBooks compatible).\nShare\nWe take pride in having great documentation and we are very appreciative of any help we can get.
